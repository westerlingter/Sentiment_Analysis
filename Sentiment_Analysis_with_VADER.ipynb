I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!

The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\\n- Attentive service with quick seating and frequent drink/water refills.\\n- Amusing name.\\n\\nBAD:\\n- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\\n- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.

      "dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really, what more do you need?  i'm sitting here trying to think of any complaints i have about him, but i'm really drawing a blank. Unfortunately, the frustration of being Dr. Goldberg's patient is a repeat of the experience I've had with so many other doctors in NYC -- good doctor, terrible staff.  It seems that his staff simply never answers the phone.  It usually takes 2 hours of repeated calling to get an answer.  Who has time for that or wants to deal with it?  I have run into this problem with many other doctors and I just don't get it.  You have office workers, you have patients with medical needs, why isn't anyone answering the phone?  It's incomprehensible and not work the aggravation.  It's with regret that I feel that I have to give Dr. Goldberg 2 stars. Dr. Goldberg has been my doctor for years and I like him.  I've found his office to be fairly efficient.  Today I actually got to see the doctor a few minutes early!  \n",
      "\n",
      "He seems very engaged with his patients and his demeanor is friendly, yet authoritative.    \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm glad to have Dr. Goldberg as my doctor. Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him, not my now former gyn Dr. Markoff, that I found out I have fibroids. He explores all options with you and is very patient and understanding. He doesn't judge and asks all the right questions. Very thorough and wants to be kept in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life. Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date! I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona, but let me tell you, STAY AWAY from this doctor and this office. I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money. Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. \n",
      "It is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great. Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors, Dr. Goldberg is very accessible and we have been able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly. We are happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to being his patients for many years to come. I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill, and no one ever called me back. I had to hound them to get an answer about my bill. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, and most important, make sure your insurance is going to cover Dr. Goldberg's visits and blood work. He recommended to me that I get a physical, and he knew I was a student because I told him. I got the physical done. Later, I found out my health insurance doesn't pay for preventative visits. I received an $800.00 bill for the blood work. I can't pay for my bill because I'm a student and don't have any cash flow at this current time. I can't believe the Doctor wouldn't give me a heads up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasn't necessary and was strictly preventative. The office can't do anything to help me cover the bill. In addition, the office staff said the onus is on me to make sure my insurance covers visits. Frustrating situation! I love Dr. Goldberg. Best doctor I've ever had, and I've had a bunch after moving around a lot in the past 25 years. Good listener, friendly & straightforward. Always presents options and takes a \"let's try the least extreme course\" first. Office staff has improved tremendously since Dr. Johnson left. Highest recommendation. All the food is great here. But the best thing they have is their wings. Their wings are simply fantastic!!  The \"Wet Cajun\" are by the best & most popular.  I also like the seasoned salt wings.  Wing Night is Monday & Wednesday night, $0.75 whole wings!\n",
      "\n",
      "The dining area is nice. Very family friendly! The bar is very nice is well.  This place is truly a Yinzer's dream!!  \"Pittsburgh Dad\" would love this place n'at!! We checked this place out this past Monday for their wing night. We have heard that their wings are great and decided it was finally time to check it out. Their wings are whole wings and crispy, which is a nice change of pace. I got their wet Cajun sauce and garlic butter wings. The Cajun did not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce is too thin. The sauce was also thin for the garlic butter, but that is more expected. They were better than average, but I don't like seeing all the sauce resting at the bottom of the boat. I would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu, but this will probably not become a regular stop for wings anytime soon. Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy, but for $1 a wing the sauce could be better. The hot and extra hot are about the same flavor/heat.  The fish sandwich is good and is a large portion, sides are decent. Cold cheap beer. Good bar food. Good service. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking for a great Pittsburgh style fish sandwich, this is the place to go. The breading is light, fish is more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fries. \n",
      "\n",
      "Good grilled chicken salads or steak.  Soup of day is homemade and lots of specials. Great place for lunch or bar snacks and beer. Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however, the grass range needs to be tended too.  It's like hitting out of US Open type rough...not very amenable to practicing.  Which kind of defeats the purpose of going to a golf range...Still gets 3 stars because the range is lit up at night which is excellent for those of us who are addicted to this amazing game, but are somewhat short on time (having a job kinda sucks sometimes, no?). Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats, clean balls and accessible hours.  Hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the balls.  This place has none of them.  It is april and there are no grass tees yet.  BTW they opened for the season this week although it has been golfing weather for a month.  The mats look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt Irene's house.  Worn and thread bare.  Let's talk about the hours.  This place is equipped with lights yet they only sell buckets of balls until 730.  It is still light out.  Finally lets you have the pit to hit into.  When I arrived I wasn't sure if this was a driving range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mining operation.  There is no grass on the range. Just mud.  Makes it a good tool to figure out how far you actually are hitting the ball.  Oh, they are cash only also.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bottom line, this place sucks.  The best hope is that the owner sells it to someone that actually wants to make money and service golfers in Pittsburgh. This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available, including all the grass tees.  It is cash only, and they sell the last bucket at 8, despite having lights.  And if you finish even a minute after 8, don't plan on getting a drink.  The vending machines are sold out (of course) and they sell drinks inside, but close the drawers at 8 on the dot.  There are weeds grown all over the place.  I noticed some sort of batting cage, but it looks like those are out of order as well.  Someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be. Before I finally made it over to this range I heard the same thing from most people - it's just fine to go work on your swing. I had such a low expectation I was pleasantly surprised. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a fairly big range - if you are familiar with Scally's in Moon, it seems like it has almost as many tees, though its not nearly as nice a facility. \n",
      "\n",
      "The guys in the pro shop were two of the friendlier guys I've come across at ranges or at courses. Yards were indeed marked and there are some targets to aim for, and even some hazards to aim away from. \n",
      "\n",
      "A big red flag to me was the extra charge ($3) to hit off the grass. I am no range expert, but this is the 4th one I've been to and the first I've seen of that sort of nickel and diming....\n",
      "\n",
      "Price for the golf balls was reasonable and I do plan to be back every week until they close up in October for the season. Hopefully, since its for sale, it will reopen as a golf facility again. I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf, which may or many not help your game, but it looks really nice.  The tee boxes look state of the art and the club house looks like something you'll see on a newer course.  Can't wait to experience it! THANK YOU ROB! i truly appreciated all the help i received from this agent today who was able to removed the extra charges on my bill that the Pasadena Verizon Store on Lake was charging me on my bill for upgrading my phone.   When i went in i was having problems with my Blacberry and had to switch to the Iphone last week. Rob from the Pennsylvania store who i was connected today was able to look at my bill and all the notes and correct the problem immediately. Great Customer Service! He even set up a FOLLOW UP Phone Call with me On July 5th to make sure the credit goes through on my bill...I can't thank him enough!!!! After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program, our customer service rep incorrectly processed the transaction. This led to us waiting another 30 minutes for him to correct it. Don't visit this store if you want pleasant or good service. I visited this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plans. The agent was pleasant and helpful. I would recommend a visit to this store. This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \"25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben, Fish Sandwich and Open-Faced Steak Sandwich.  We went early afternoon for a late lunch today (a Saturday) and were seated right away.  The staff is extremely friendly.  My Mom & I each had the fish sandwich, while my Dad & Brother had a Reuben sandwich.  The fish was very good, but the Reuben was to die for!  Both dishes were massive, and could very easily be shared between two people.  On top of being extremely large portions, it was incredibly affordable.  The giant fish sandwich was $8 and the giant Reuben was $7.50.  Our drinks were always filled and we were checked on several times during the meal.  We will definitely be back!!!  Oh and a bit of advice ahead of time - they take CASH ONLY.  So come prepared, but I'm pretty sure I saw an ATM there as well.  And I do believe they are closed on Sundays & Mondays. Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh. This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't, they don't need to get any busier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its been there ages, and looks it. If you're all about ambiance, don't bother. If you pretend you're in a movie set in Pittsburgh 30 years ago it works pretty well. The service is sometimes hit or miss. Most of girls are good, one is very slow, one is amazing. They are all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that you're happy. Everything is made fresh so be prepared that nothing comes flying out of that kitchen - busy times it can take a good while to get food. \n",
      "\n",

      "The prices are low, the portions are large, and just about everything on the menu  is delicious. I'm not one to pick a place because they give you a lot of food, but if you like a good value and don't want to compromise on taste, this place is a gem. This place was very good. I found out about Emil's when watching a show called \"25 Things I Love About Pittsburgh\" on WQED hosted by Rick Seback. This place ain't a luxurious restaurant...it's a beer & a shot bar / lounge. But the people are friendly & the food is good. I had the fish sandwich which was great. It ain't in a great part of town, Rankin, but I've been in worse places!! Try this place. Old school.....traditional \"mom 'n pop\" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way, non-corporate, vestige of Americana. You will love it. Seen this restaurant on 25 best places in Pittsburgh with Rick Seback\n",
      "ack. Went there with my girlfriend she grew up with the owner. She's very nice all employees are super nice service was excellent i had the fish sandwich my girlfriend had the Ruben more than you could possibly eat very reasonable prices. Going back to try the burgers  i heard there enormous and very tasty. Wonderful reuben.  Map shown on Yelp page is incorrect. It is actually a different Hawkins.  I'd recommend a call for directions 412-271-9911. Good fish sandwich. After a morning of Thrift Store hunting, a friend and I were thinking of lunch, and he suggested Emil's after he'd seen Chris Sebak do a bit on it and had tried it a time or two before, and I had not. He said they had a decent Reuben, but to be prepared to step back in time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, seeing as how I'm kind of addicted to late 40's and early 50's, and the whole Rat Pack scene, stepping back in time is a welcomed change in da burgh...as long as it doesn't involve 1979, which I can see all around me every day.\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet another shot at finding a decent Reuben in da burgh...well, that's like hunting the Holy Grail. So looking under one more bush certainly wouldn't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "So off we go right at lunchtime in the middle of...where exactly were we? At first I thought we were lost, driving around a handful of very rather dismal looking blocks in what looked like a neighborhood that had been blighted by the building of a highway. And then...AHA! Here it is! And yep, there it was. This little unassuming building with an add-on entrance with what looked like a very old hand painted sign stating quite simply 'Emil's. \n",
      "\n",
      "We walked in the front door, and entered another world. Another time, and another place. Oh, and any Big Burrito/Sousa foodies might as well stop reading now. I wouldn't want to see you walk in, roll your eyes and say 'Reaaaaaalllly?'\n",
      "\n",
      "This is about as old world bar/lounge/restaurant as it gets. Plain, with a dark wood bar on one side, plain white walls with no yinzer pics, good sturdy chairs and actual white linens on the tables. This is the kind of neighborhood dive that I could see Frank and Dino pulling a few tables together for some poker, a fish sammich, and some cheap scotch. And THAT is exactly what I love.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh...but good food counts too. \n",
      "\n",
      "We each had a Reuben, and my friend had a side of fries. The Reubens were decent, but not NY awesome. A little too thick on the bread, but overall, tasty and definitely filling. Not too skimpy on the meat. I seriously CRAVE a true, good NY Reuben, but since I can't afford to travel right now, what I find in da burgh will have to do. But as we sat and ate, burgers came out to an adjoining table. Those were some big thick burgers. A steak went past for the table behind us. That was HUGE! And when we asked about it, the waitress said 'Yeah, it's huge and really good, and he only charges $12.99 for it, ain't that nuts?' Another table of five came in, and wham. Fish sandwiches PILED with breaded fish that looked amazing. Yeah, I want that, that, that and THAT!\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend also mentioned that they have a Chicken Parm special one day of the week that is only served UNTIL 4 pm, and that it is fantastic. If only I could GET there on that week day before 4...\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitress did a good job, especially since there was quite a growing crowd at lunchtime on a Saturday, and only one of her. She kept up and was very friendly. \n",
      "\n",
      "They only have Pepsi products, so I had a brewed iced tea, which was very fresh, and she did pop by to ask about refills as often as she could. As the lunch hour went on, they were getting busy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Emil's is no frills, good portions, very reasonable prices, VERY comfortable neighborhood hole in the wall...kind of like Cheers, but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950's. Fan-freakin-tastic! I could feel at home here.\n",
      "\n",
      "You definitely want to hit Mapquest or plug in your GPS though. I am not sure that I could find it again on my own...it really is a hidden gem. I will be making my friend take me back until I can memorize where the heck it is.\n",
      "\n",
      "Addendum: 2nd visit for the fish sandwich. Excellent. Truly. A pound of fish on a fish-shaped bun (as opposed to da burgh's seemingly popular hamburger bun). The fish was flavorful, the batter excellent, and for just $8. This may have been the best fish sandwich I've yet to have in da burgh. This is a hidden gem, no really. It took us forever to find but well worth it. It is right across the street from the Rankin Police Station. The menu has a wide selection, I really couldn't decide what I wanted but I went with the ribeye sandwich. I'm glad i did too. Huge sandwich! I added mushrooms, it was very flavorful. My boyfriend got the fish sandwich, he enjoyed it as well. Fast and friendly service. Will definitely be back. This would be my local haunt, if I were ever to relocate to the Pittsburgh area. What a great little place! Such friendly staff, and some damn good eats!\n",
      " \n",
      "It was so great, that we actually went there twice during our 4-day vacation to catch the Steelers/Ravens game. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have daily sandwich specials. On Thursday night we went and had the special roast beef and cheese sand., and the .35 cent wings. Very, very tasty. I'm sorry, but this place kicks Primanti Bros. butt on the taste factor. They have about 8 different types of wings... reg., garlic, and I can't remember the rest - we got the regular, and I was wishing we would had ordered more.\n",
      "\n",
      "Going back on a Friday night, we ordered the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n' mushroom.  Wow! That buffalo chicken pizza was awesome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The other thing that stuck out for me was one of the customers. An older gentleman; he seemed to be a regular. I really, really wanted his SPAM t-shirt. A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans, young men in collared shirts, and thirtysomethings have probably seen it all during their time at this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The staff was top notch - the orders were somewhat overwhelming as they appeared short-staffed for the night, but my waitress tried to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit. The other waiter was wearing a hooded cardigan, and I wanted to steal it from him due to my difficulty in finding such a quality article of clothing.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a white pizza - large in size, engulfed in cheese, full of garlic flavor, flavorful hot sausage. An overall delicious pizza, aside from 2 things: 1, way too much grease (I know this comes with the territory, but still, it is sometimes unbearable); 2, CANNED MUSHROOMS - the worst thing to come out of a can. Ever. I would rather eat canned Alpo than canned mushrooms. And if the mushrooms weren't canned, they were just the worst mushrooms I've ever consumed. The mushroom debacle is enough to lower the review by an entire star - disgusting!\n",
      "\n",
      "My advice for the place is keep everything awesome - random music from the jukebox, tasty food, great prices, good crowd and staff - and get some decent mushrooms; why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap, I'll never know. Alexion's has been around forever.  The first time I went in there, I was 19 years old on summer break from college and working at the ice cream factory up the hill.  All of the union guys from the ice cream factory went in there after work, and I immediately found out why.  MANY, MANY years later, I stopped in there with some fond memories, and once again felt welcomed and valued as a customer, even though they didn't know who I was.  THE SANDWICHES are done Pittsburgh-style, sort of like Primanti's, and they are as perfect today as they were back in ancient times when I first started visiting the place.  Alexion's is a clean and peaceful little place in the Rook Station part of Green Tree, the oldest part of the town.  I recall that some of the sandwiches I got there were ordered at a pretty late hour.  Nothing but good things to say about the place, and I wish it was closer to home! Good for cheap drinks and wings, they offer daily specials which is nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Doesnt look like much from outside but the inside is friendly enough, the bartenders have been there for awhile and do a good job. Dont expect to have a HUGE selection of alcohol. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their wings are good as are their salads. If you are gluten free this is not your place...lots of fried food and sandwiches. \n",
      "Offers a quick lunch. What a cool bar/restaurant.. I will no doubt be visiting again.  The service and prices were great.. and the restrooms were clean.   I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and it was delicious.  The menu consists of typical bar food food, however; theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu..\n",
      "\n",
      "A cool bar off the beaten path that is a worth a trip.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Cheers ! ! Awesome drink specials during happy hour. Fantastic wings that are crispy and delicious, wing night on Tuesday and Thursday! Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd, it wasn't her fault she was the only server. But it took about an hour to get our sandwiches. Mine was one of the best reubens I've ever had. Grew up near here. the family would always go once a month. Haven't stopped in for a few years until last Friday with a few friends to grab a drink. The sandwiches are always amazing just as I remember. The staff is amazing and friendly. Great place for lunch as well. Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting. Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly, the food is amazing, and the wings? Oh the wings... but it's still about the cheeseburger. The atmosphere is inviting, but you can't eat atmosphere... so go right now. Grab the car keys... you know you're hungry for an amazing cheeseburger, maybe some wings, and a cold beer! Easily, hands down, the best bar and grill in Pittsburgh. The sandwiches, the wings, enough said. Alexions can best be described as a home-style Primantis before they went mega commercial. You really can't go wrong, but for my money, I would put Alexions fish sandwich up with the best I've had. That's not to take away from other selections, but if you come here I recommend not leaving until you've had either the fish sandwich, Reuben, or wings. \n",
      "\n",
      "You'll know you're in a Pittsburgh bar when you walk in. For someone who lives in Atlanta now and only makes it to Pittsburgh a few times a year, I have to say it is refreshing. Feels like home. I haven't had a trip back without making it out to Alexions at least once. We met a couple of friends there on a Friday afternoon about 440 pm, based on the Yelp reviews. I've relied on Yelp in over a dozen different cities, never came away with anything less than a positive experience until today. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered within 5 minutes of sitting down, there couldn't have been more than 20 people in the place, counting the people on the patio.  Took them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwiches and a salad. I tried the fish sandwich, came out fried extra crispy on the ends, if there is such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualified, it was just ok. I've had better at almost any church that fries fish during Lent. \n",
      "\n",
      "All 3 of my dinner companions left partial sandwiches  or salad uneaten. Bread french fries and onion rings were good though. Iced tea was good, though I've never seen a place dispense sweet n low like they were giving away their last rock of crack. Asked for sugar but never saw any, they don't carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "I may give the place another try in the future for a Reuben or hamburger, assuming today was some aberration possibly due to a cook having a family emergency or something like that. Waitress was pretty good, held up under my multiple requests to find out if they caught my fish yet, hardly ever rolled her eyes :) Used to go there for tires, brakes, etc.  Their prices have gone way up-$400 for 4 mid-level tires for a Toyota.  Plus, 1 of the new tires went flat within 3 weeks.  Since they don\"t make appointments,  the wait to get the tire looked at was ~2 hours.  Sorry--can't wait that long to get a warranted repair,  They lost my business for good. I got 'new' tires from them and within two weeks got a flat. I took my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patched, but they said the reason I had a flat was because the previous patch had blown - WAIT, WHAT? I just got the tire and never needed to have it patched? This was supposed to be a new tire. \n",
      "I took the tire over to Flynn's and they told me that someone punctured my tire, then tried to patch it. So there are resentful tire slashers? I find that very unlikely. After arguing with the guy and telling him that his logic was far fetched he said he'd give me a new tire \"this time\". \n",
      "I will never go back to Flynn's b/c of the way this guy treated me and the simple fact that they gave me a used tire! Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow, over priced, I'll go elsewhere next time. Contrary to other reviews, I have zero complaints about the service or the prices. I have been getting tire service here for the past 5 years now, and compared to my experience with places like Pep Boys, these guys are experienced and know what they're doing. \n",
      "Also, this is one place that I do not feel like I am being taken advantage of, just because of my gender. Other auto mechanics have been notorious for capitalizing on my ignorance of cars, and have sucked my bank account dry. But here, my service and road coverage has all been well explained - and let up to me to decide. \n",
      "And they just renovated the waiting room. It looks a lot better than it did in previous years. Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \"fixed\" it for free, and the very next morning I had the same issue. I called to complain, and the \"manager\" didn't even apologize!!! So frustrated. Never going back.  They seem overpriced, too. Most random location for a mini golf course ever.  This is old school. It's built into the woods (spray yourself for bugs first) right off Forsythe Rd near Carnegie Park.  The candy hut is fun to spend your spare change.  They recently re-carpeted the holes and added a few gimmicks that weren't there before.  It won't knock your socks off, but if you're local, give it a try! This quaint mini golf course is one of the oldest, yet most original and fun locations that I have yet visited.  Coming from Texas, it was nice to see a course located amongst the hilly and woody Pennsylvanian terrain. It can be frustrating that it is literally impossible to make a hole-in-one on most every hole and that the course also makes it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce.  The cartoon-like outrageousness of the course proved to give laughs and a fun attempt to play.  Improvements were being made and I will look forward to returning on my next visit to the Pittsburgh area.  I enjoy traveling and visiting new courses and the only reason why I didn't give this location 5 stars is because it was impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par. I think this place is closed. Their number is out of service, sign is gone and the course has not been maintained. Awesome woodsy mess of a course though! I've been informed by a fellow Yelper that they are just closed for the season, I hope they're right! I find it strange they don't keep their phone number in service with a recording and that they didn't cover the course up to protect it from weather, vandalism, etc. Either way, I can't wait to get my game on in the spring! Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times, we never heard from them.  Not a call, not the estimate, nothing. I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well, it all started in May when we had a man named Al come out and talk to us about the process. He was a true salesman, I'll tell you that. Not a straight shooter, but an excited salesman that wanted to sell... And we bought into it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He told us they were backed up with the harsh winter and a lot of jobs, but they could probably start by June 24th. Mind you, this was the end of May we met with him. He said they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from Dormont before they started. We felt confident in going with them, and booked it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where things fell apart. Weeks went by with no word from them on the process. Finally I called and left messages. Al finally got in touch with me and the conversation was utterly confusing. He must have not understood me because he just kept talking in circles. So I hung up not knowing what was going on. Finally I called back and the admin told me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back. I wish Al would have told us that.\n",
      "\n",
      "So our June 24th date came and went. We finally got our survey. And they were quick to bill us for it, but no word on where we were in the process. I called back a couple times with no real answers from the admin. Apparently they were now waiting for the permit from Dormont.\n",
      "\n",
      "A month later, I was frustrated and asked to speak with someone at the company. I spoke with someone who told me that Dormont usually takes a week to process the permit, but we were now going on a month. He told me he would bug the guy about it and we finally got it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I completely understand that waiting on the permit is not their fault, but why no communication about it? Just call me and tell me they're waiting for the permit, but they'll work towards asking Dormont what the hold up is. Seems simple.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally we get the permit and work is supposed to start. Tuesday comes and they have to wait for approval from Dormont on holes they're digging. So holes are dug and equipment is put in my backyard and then nothing happens for two days. Where did everyone go? Who knows, because I wasn't informed! \n",
      "\n",
      "I was upset and contacted the company owner, Dave, by email. I told him how frustrated I was about the lack of communication. He wrote me two sentences that  said \"there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be done tomorrow.\" Well, that didn't happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then two other dudes show up two days later and did work for about three hours and left. The main guy comes back the next day and says they did it wrong. So apparently the part about how they wouldn't need access to my house changes to they're drilling bolts into my house to secure he deck. \n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the second week into construction, my tiny 10x11 foot deck is done. It was upsetting that they left the deck dirty, and all the dirt and cement they moved around wasn't cleaned up. I even asked them to fill all the holes they dug up and didn't use, and they only filled up one. When you create a construction project, isn't it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice? Didn't happen here.\n",
      "\n",
      "My main point is, contractors have a reputation for not being the most trustworthy. Why be that company? Why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust? My main issues with them were that things were not communicated to me properly up front, nor was the ongoing process communicated to me. Then they left everything unfinished in my eyes, leaving the site dirty. I understand things happen and things get delayed, but just email or call me. It's not that hard to keep me updated, it is 2014 with a million ways to be contacted.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even though I have a nice deck (after I clean things up myself!), I would not recommend them to anyone. When I wanted a deck for the back of my home I ended up calling Quaker State Construction. It ended up working very well and they were very polite. I got an estimate and called them to start working out the details of my new deck. Once we got the plans all sorted out they started building my new deck and it was finished with in a reasonable amount of time. I now have a beautiful deck that I can relax and that my family can enjoy. Overall, they did a good job and I would use them in the future for all my deck necessities. I have never seen a restaurant that has a frowning brownie (a.k.a. Frownie) as their icon, mascot, or spokesperson.  King's Family Restaurant has surprised me with this.  I think it might be in direct dialogue with Eat N' Parks smiling cookie -- funny (funny odd, not funny ha-ha).  We were seated rather quickly by the manager.  Very nice people work here, I was happy to find that even though they had closed a section, the server was willing to stay longer to serve us our dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "We chatted with the server a little bit -- she was quite engaging -- and then moved on to order our meal:\n",
      "\n",
      "Tea\n",
      "Pepsi\n",
      "Open-faced Hot Turkey Sandwich with mashed potatoes and gravy\n",
      "Buffalo Chicken strips with mashed potatoes and macaroni n' cheese\n",
      "\n",
      "Our drinks arrived and our server conversed with us some more about the area.  She would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other tables had everything they needed.  Eventually, our entrees arrived -- both piping hot.  I went straight for the macaroni and cheese.  It didn't taste bad, but I swear that it is made by Stouffers.  I didn't feel the need to eat that much knowing that there were other things to eat.  I tried the mashed potatoes and found that they too came from a package; but, again, they didn't taste bad with the brown gravy.  I moved on to the main part of my meal -- the buffalo chicken strips.  At least they were all white meat and the buffalo sauce was more than just mild.  I contented myself with eating them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I tried some of the hot turkey sandwich and just left the rest for my friend since it was not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that had been heated.  I finished off my dinner and was happy in the end.  No, it wasn't the best food in the world, but the service greatly helped the perception and it didn't taste bad. So... back in the late 90s, there used to be this super-kick-ass cinnamon ice cream, like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust.  SO DELICIOUS!\n",

      "However, NOW there is some shit-tastic replacement that tastes like vanilla ice cream with last year's red-hot in the middle: totally gross.  Fortunately, our server was nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample, so I only had to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also having to pay for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portions are big and filling, just don't come for the ice cream. Ive pretty much been eating at various Kings' pretty regularly since I was a child when my parents would take my sister and I into the Fox Chapel location often.  Lately me and my girl have been visiting the Heidelburg location. I love the food, it really tastes homemade, much like something a grandmother would make, complete with gobs of butter and side dishes. Prices are low, selection is great, but dont expect fine dining by any means. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is hit or miss at pretty much all of them; if you have lunch at any Kings, you will likely be waited on by a sweet but sarcastic  older lady who has been doing the waiting thing for 30 years and knows her game. Seek out this lady.  My experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "Im in my 30s now, and very little has changed, other than the Fox Chapel location was remodeled about 10 years ago to look less like a diner, which was a big fail.  Any girl I meet has to enjoy Kings or she's out. Hoofah. I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca. I arrived around 10 am on a Saturday morning.  I was greeted by the hostess,who was polite and friendly, and I informed her that I was alone.  She had just arrived, as well, and wasn't exactly sure what was going on yet, so she asked (the manager?) where she should seat me.  After receiving guidance, she brought me to a table towards the back.  It had not yet been cleaned after the previous guests had dined.  So, she quickly got it cleared off, grabbed a rag, and wiped it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "The waitress came rather quickly to take my drink order.  She was extremely friendly.  I ordered coffee and water, which she went and got while I looked over the menu.  She returned, and took my order.  I ordered the Cinnamon Swirl French Toast Special - Three slices of French toast made with Pittsburgh's own Jenny Lee® Cinnamon Swirl, two farm-fresh eggs, with bacon or sausage (I chose sausage), and your choice of potato (I went with the cheesy hash brown casserole).  I also added an orange juice.  She went and put my order in, while I waited, and came back with it after not too long.   The eggs were cooked exactly how I wanted them, the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast were both delicious.  I also enjoyed the sausage which was pretty typical.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kings Family Restaurant featured a very friendly staff, great prices, and tasty food.  I am pleased and will definitely come back again. thisis not the closest Kings to us, but we often will travel the extra miles because the service and food at this location is always the best. Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on. Not bad for a Shop N Save, most are privately owned, so availability of items might differ from place to place. The only time I frequent S n S is when the have their huge two day sales usually held on Thursday and Friday at least once month.\n",
      "\n",
      "Good bakery at this location too. Two meals, on the recommendation of a friend who lives near the place, and after the second trip, I was compelled to write. 'Rocky' would definitely describe the experiences.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the first trip, I went to try their (at that time)raved about Reuben. And YET to find a true good Reuben in da burgh, I tried it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, they were out of the proper bread, and the guy had to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find, which was not the proper bread, and instead of one of their 'raved about' Reubens, I received two mini-Reubens, which basically took the guts from one Reuben, and spread it out onto two sandwiches on regular sized bread. I ate it. It wasn't great, but they swore it was because they'd run out of the bread. Bread or not, it still wasn't great. The atmosphere was pleasant in that 'blue collar bar' kind of way, and the staff was very nice, but not a winning pitch on the Reuben.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second trip was after a long day of moving furniture with the same friend. Sat in the back room, instead of the bar, which felt more like a restaurant, of course, with the big screen TV covering the sports of the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "I was in the mood for dinner this time, and after a scan, decided on fried chicken and mashed potatoes with the salad bar. My friend ordered one of her faves, the breaded pork chops.\n",
      "\n",
      "We hit the salad bar, which was uber-basic. Three soups (mostly vegetable loaded, which left me out), basic iceberg lettuce mix (very probably out of a bag), a few veggie toppings, and three or four dressings. It was a basic salad, no big deal. More or less an appetizer filler before the meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mind-blower in this trip was the ordering of the fried chicken dinner. Our waiter looked like a 19 year old gas station attendant, skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face, and an air of vapidity, which was confirmed when I placed my order. I asked what chicken pieces came in the dinner, and asked if it was possible to only get dark meat. I never imagined how confusing a question that could possibly be. It literally took him two trips back to the kitchen to 'ask', and the child honestly had no clue what 'white meat' and 'dark meat' meant. The first answer he came back with was that the chicken came in a pre-portioned prepared bag, kind of Kentucky Fried Chicken style...which didn't answer my question, thus prompting the second trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "After the second trip back I heard the cook holler 'Tell him I'll fix him up'. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well, the chicken was prepackaged dreck like you'd find in the freezer case of Walmart, tiny and not good, and the potatoes had that slight tinge of chem-spuds flavor, laden with some kind of chopped up green (parsley?), and a side of that basic brown gravy served up in 5 gallon buckets.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thank goodness for the basic salad bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even my friend admitted that her pork chops were different and not what she'd expected. They also appeared to be from a freezer bag.\n",
      "\n",
      "The irony was that the boy who didn't know white meat from dark meat, was chatting with some other customers...about baseball...and he was a genius about the mindless sport of baseball. Ahhhh da burgh.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third base? Nah...why bother when there are so many other options around. Go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in Carnegie...they can help you out all types of ways in that area. Just don't go hungry if you actually have tastebuds.\n",
      "\n",
      "From what I understand it 'used to be' really good homecooked food. But apparently, mama has left the kitchen. everything was great! If you are searching for a go to fish place for Lent....look no further.  This place will give you the best fish sandwich in Pittsburgh.  The sandwich has enough fish to make four sandwiches.  You will not be able to finish this sandwich in one seating.\n",
      "Enjoy.... Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine, pretentious!  Everyday, well prepared and taste bud pleasing home style cooking.  I've mostly gone during supper hours and  and ate in the dining room, but, today I introduced an old friend to \"linner\" in the bar.\n",
      "He ordered the large version of fish sandwich.  Rocky's is famous for their fish.  Three large breaded and fried fish filets, bun and fries for under $10.  Needless to say, he had no complaints and brought home more than he ate.\n",
      "I ordered the meatball grill.  It was delish.  Served on thick cut Italian bread and made \"grilled cheese\" (mozzarella) style.  Meatballs and tomato sauce are both good!  Also, served with fries.  I brought home half the sandwich.\n",
      "Another good meal there.  Friends, mother, and former boss all enjoy their food! Italian dinners, American, endless soup and salad bar is great. Most food for your dollar. I highly recommend. Great bar. Good place to watch a game. The bar can get quite noisy in the evenings, but it adds to the great atmosphere at Rocky's If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning, come here. This greasy spoon is always packed, and is one of the better of its kind south of the city.\n",
      "\n",
      "They serve waffles in halves, which is great. The eggs and toast are good, the homemade hot sausage is excellent. The drawback are the barely cooked potatoes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're hungry, get \"The Mixed Grill\"... Gab and Eat's brand of the \"kitchen sink\" breakfast that all Midwest places are about. Good Luck getting a seat, that's all I have to say. The Gab and Eat is famous and infamous. Diner food is what's up and I like it. When I was a roofing mechanic, we'd meet there before work. Although I'm not sure I would recommend it if you're working were there's no bathrooms. hehe Stick to basics and this is the best place in or around the 'burgh.  First time go with a friend and sit at the counter.  Short order cooking at it's best, it's like a floor show with the actor's backs to you.  Breakfast has no losers.  Eggs, omelets, pancakes, waffles, breakfast sandwiches to order, the ever popular mixed grill, get a 1/2 Louie instead of home fries (although they good as is) and don't forget the italian toast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Frequently voted the best burger in Pittsburgh for a reason.  As for ambiance, well lets just say I don't think there are two matching plates or coffee mugs in the joint.  But the coffee's good and hot and refreshed often as the service is good, andlocal with many long time folks working here.  If I don't get there for awhile I need to go through detox because I feel too healthy. The biggest breakfast in Pittsburgh, as far as I can tell - and delicious and cheap too. I ordered some mix of eggs, bacon and pancakes - and got 2 dinner-sized plates, one loaded with pancakes and the other stuffed with eggs, bacon, and home fries. Oh, and a side of toast. For under $5, if I recall.\n",
      "\n",
      "HUGE portions, all well-executed; as good as DeLuca's.\n",
      "\n",
      "I've not had anything besides breakfast, so can't comment on the burger or anything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Cramped quarters, and you'll have to wait, but when nothing but monster morning food will do, this is the destination. Cheap, unpretentious, and, for this, one of my favorite breakfast joints in the country.  Simply put I LOVE it here.  The mixed grill, the sausage and egg on a biscuit, the home fries.  This it the very definition of diner.  Thank you Gab 'n' Eat! Okay, let's first set expectations.  This place is a true DIVE...this is not for the NYC foodie crowd.  If you want a down home, large portion awesome breakfast, this is the place.  The place is packed with happy diners, the server was very friendly in a busy grandma kind of way.  The best part - they have \"dippy\" eggs on the menu and define the degree of dippy you can order.  For anyone who has never heard of a \"dippy\" egg - this means sunny side up or over medium where the eggs are still runny and you can dip your bread in them.  The eggs were great - I ordered mine over medium, the breakfast potatoes were fab - no complicated additives like peppers or onions - just plain good potatoes cooked in fat - the best part - the fresh Italian bread.  YUM!!! I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh, I remember cutting morning classes in highschool just to get after the best bacon egg and cheese i know of. Honestly i live in nyc where you can get a bacon egg and cheese on every single corner, and nowhere that i have been does it as well as this joint. Go here and you will be happy you did. I've lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years, and in Carnegie for over 2 years, and by far, this is the best greasy spoon joint I've found. If you can stomach the wait (no reservations, naturally), you'll enjoy overflowing plates of goodness, thanks to the well-seasoned griddle where all of the food is made. \n",
      "\n",
      "Here are the highlights:\n",
      "\n",
      "-Cheap: Breakfast for two can be well under $10, with lunch around the same.\n",
      "-Crowded: Get there early and expect to wait. They close pretty early on the weekends too (oddly, at 12:45pm)\n",
      "-Cash only\n",
      "-Huge portions: When ordering fries or homefries, always get the half order, unless you're a lumberjack\n",
      "-About those homefries: They're often undercooked. I've had better, believe me. My favorite things to eat in life are potato products.\n",
      "-My favorite item: hot sausage sandwich on thick Italian toast, with cheese, lettuce, tomato and mayo Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line. My favorite breakfast place.  Have good sandwiches also.  Stopped again for Bfast and had the mixed grill--get the small portion unless you are a real MAN!  Mixed grill has sausage, (could it be Ricci's?), eggs, onions, and home fries, soooo goooooooood!  Use Mancini's bread for toast, got the raisin toast - Yum.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Have had many other items and just love the food.  If you like to watch a true cook, sit at the counter.  Banter with the cook and staff and patrons is fun!\n",
      "\n",
      "Lunch is good, sausage sandwich, hamburgers and other lunch meats fried on the grill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gets busy for Bfast so you may have to wait.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember it is a diner.  Don't expect fancy decor. Definitely a greasy spoon! Always packed here and always a wait but worth it. The omelets are really tastey especially with their homemade sausage. I also like the mixed grill.  My parents love their burgers. Took off a star for lumpy booths and really tight tables (your arm gets hit when someone walks past) oh and waitresses aren't very attentive. If you're looking for no frills but a great breakfast this is the place. I got the mixed grill half portion and was very full. Make sure you have extra calories for the day because they are not afraid to use butter. Loved the breakfast and would go back. Not much room for sitting down but worth the wait. Great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel. \n",
      "\n",
      "Reminds me of the one my parents used to own in Mi. \n",
      "\n",
      "Have fun finding a table on the weekend :) Great breakfast place. Come hungry. Look for Dick, my dad, and Gino at the counter every a.m. about 0830 and say hi. Try the mixed grill (half). OK, what is with all of these \"CASH ONLY\" places in Pittsburgh? I can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble installing a credit card system in their store/resturant, but could you perhaps provide an ATM?  In the past, this would deter me from eating at this place. \n",
      "\n",
      "Looking at a standard breakfast menu, I decided to go with a tuna melt instead. What I got was a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast. I had ordered a melt being in the mood for a warm meal, but to no avail. One day later I can't even remember what my side was. I suppose it didn't leave much of an impression on me.  I have to say that the dessert was really good! The cherry pecan pie! I have not seen this concoction anywhere else but this was awesome! The cherries were not the sweet canned variety, but a pie worthy tart topped with sugar. I think I want to make this pie with my parents next harvest of our cherry tree!\n",
      "\n",
      "My first impression is \"Eh.\"  I am learning how crazy Pittsburghers are over breakfast! Seriously, waiting 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that reads as follows:  \n",
      "\n",
      "\"2 eggs and toast $x.xx\"\n",
      "\"2 eggs, meat, and toast $x.xx\"\n",
      "\"2 eggs and pancake $x.xx\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I'd rather go to a Denny's and order the \"create your own Grand Slam!\" BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you, but Everything I ate was clearly the opposite of healthy.  After trying like every meal they have I would recommend the mix grill(half unless you are sharing) adding cajun seasoning with the texas toast.  Burgers are great too.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's hard to find a place that makes a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home, but this place does it.  The atmosphere is classy, old school Americana. Best French toast ever!! Love the friendly atmosphere, and especially the breakfast. Never been disappointed. You have to try French toast with raisin bread too... yummy! Great Diner!  Their breakfast is the best in the area!  Lots of  choices and always good.  Love the unique mugs they use for coffee and all the writing on the wall.  Get there early otherwise you will not get a seat!  They have homemade hot/sweet sausage and texas toast. Readers of my reviews may recall that I once referred to The Dor-Stop as possibly the best breakfast in Pittsburgh.  Well, faithful followers, I must now admit that The Dor-Stop has now been verified as only one of the best.  Why?  That's because Gab and Eat I have now found to be THE best breakfast I've ever had.  If it was closer to my home I would quickly become a regular.\n",
      "\n",
      "I easily decided to order the Mixed Grill (Half).  Before I go on, I must ask...has anyone seen a full order?  Because I honestly can't imagine how much food that is.  I created my own with bacon, cheese, eggs and potatoes.  Based on reviews I also opted to get a side of the sausage and was pleased as punch when our waitress asked if I wanted hot or sweet....or one of each.  I like variety, so I jumped on the change to try both.  I also selected the Italian toast - what other kind is there, really?  \n",
      "\n",
      "When my food arrived, it looked delicious.  There was so much bacon that after eating half of my Mixed Grill it looked like I'd barely started.  The sausage was great, just don't ask me which one I liked best.  My toast?  4 thick slices that looked to be about half the loaf and were buttered on both sides. It was a struggle, but I was determined to enjoy every tasty morsel and not leave a crumb.   \n",
      "\n",
      "In case anyone is wondering, yes, they use real butter.  I saw pounds of it stacked in the kitchen with my own two eyes.  The wait staff was quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people.  The fact that none of the plates match and I noticed a sign at the front register that said, \"We need mugs\" just makes me love this place even more.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few tips: 1.) Order the Mixed Grill.  2.) Cash only!  3.) Gab and Eat is a popular place but also very small and narrow (or cozy if you will).  I recommend going during the week when they are still busy but can accomodate a group.  That way you won't feel rushed or crowded.  4.) Get to Gab and Eat ASAP!  You'll be glad you did! Classic breakfast joint.  Grimy looking hole in the wall located on one end of a seedy looking strip mall.  Window is opaque due to the grease so you can't hardly see inside. On the outside, there are about a dozen people waiting to get in.  When you finally do get inside, you see that there are 15 tables and a counter, all occupied by people from all walks of life.\n",
      "\n",
      "What's the attraction behind this flea hole?  The FOOD!  Lots of it and dirt cheap.  I sat at a vacant stool behind the formica counter and ordered the mixed grill.  Potatoes, eggs, sausage, bacon and Italian toast.  A giant mound of food guaranteed to sooth any hangover.  I swear the full mixed grill had two pounds of food.  Neat thing is that the grill is right in front of you so you can see your potatoes and eggs frying in a pool of fresh grease.  All that food, plus coffee and tip for around ten bucks.  Cash only, so put that plastic away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Only bad thing that could happen is some douche bag from the Food Network or Travel Channel will make this place famous, and then I'll never be able to get in. Yum - freaking - me!\n",
      "\n",
      "As the other fellower yelpers mentioned - this place is a cash only.    A couple of recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Don't eat early in the week \n",
      "- I don't recommend wearing any tight clothing (no skinny jeans) - you will not be skinny when you leave\n",

      "\n",
      " I walked in for breakfast one early weekday AM.   The place was packed with locals and regulars.    A very good sign.\n",
      "\n",
      "My co-worker recommended I get the mixed grill.   I ordered the large mix grill.   My waitress tried to warn me - it is large (very large).    I ended up eating the left-overs for the next 2 days.\n",

      "I will definitely go back after I buy some new stretchy pants. Best breakfast spot in the area, If you like diner food it is the place to go. Small, so you will want to avoid the church crowd on Sundays, but the wait is never too long.  Everyone is friendly and has obviously been working there for a while.  If you are feeling like lunch food go a little later, their burgers are made on the breakfast griddle and are delicious. Great breakfast, good price. You might have to stand outside in line though, so I don't really recommend winter time to go. lol. Very friendly service, interesting coffee mugs. They have great deserts and such also. Bring your cash though as they dont' take cards. I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. \n",
      "\n",
      "This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\"  It consisted of eggs, peppers, onions and home made sausage.  Not something you would eat everyday, but he loved it!   They also had great coffee.  They actually ground up the beans in front of us.  Now that's fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "We want to return sometime for \"turkey day.\"  Apparently they made fresh turkey every Tuesday.  Now that sounds good!\n",
      "\n",
      "Can't wait to return. This is exactly what a breakfast place should be like--comfortable, quirky, unpretentious and with inexpensive, large portioned working class breakfast plates. On our current road trip of baseball, brews, hockey and diners, we decided to try Gab & Eat based on yelpers rating putting it #1 for breakfast in Pittsburgh area. We have to agree with most other reviewers that this is a place to eat.\n",
      "We arrived around noon on Saturday and were happy there were a couple open tables. The place is tucked at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it. There is plenty of parking.\n",
      "Inside the decor is quaint and funky at the same time. Country style decorations and signs are mixed with nostalgia signs & posters. Most interesting are all the signatures and comments written on the wall by past customers. We regretted not having a marker to add ours. The other highlight was three large white boards with trivia questions - fun way to spend time waiting for food.\n",
      "The waitstaff there is...uh, experienced. They are attentive, pleasant and efficient.\n",
      "After reading reviews I had to try the Mixed Grill. But S went with pancakes with a side of bacon. The pancakes were outstanding...maybe the best either of us has eaten. They were thick but with light texture and rich flavor. \n",
      "His bacon was cooked just as requested - as crisp as possible - and very flavorful.\n",
      "The Mixed Grill is a mixed together concoction of eggs, potatoes, onions, peppers, cheese, and spicy Italian sausage grilled together. I'm glad I heeded those who stressed going with the half size order. It filled a full sized dinner plate with a heaping order. I couldn't finish it all and that's rare. How do they serve the whole potion -- in a trough?\n",
      "Everything was cooked well. The sausage added a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes. You can build your own mix but the basic was a good mix.\n",
      "My only complaint was the amount of potato and that they are pretty plain. I like home fries with lots of seasoning that have aged on the grill. These potatoes were pretty uniform chunks with little seasoning. Personal preference.\n",
      "It usually comes with Italian toast but they were out so I went with raisin. It was delicious soft inch thick slices.\n",
      "Coffee was excellent and the cup stayed full. The total was less than $15. Fabulous value for the quality and portions.\n",
      "While I can't say it's the best breakfast in Pittsburgh (only here 3 days), its the best so far and one of the best we've had. Met my nephew for lunch in Carnegie and he suggested Gab & Eat.   Way to go Justin!  The restaurant is in a strip mall across from the Dairy Queen.  The grill is right up front so you can see them cooking.   They have counter space for eating and tables/booths for 4.   Don't expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4. They have a great looking breakfast menu.   We all got burgers of varying kinds!  They were tasty!   The buns were buttered, toasted and soft.  Yum!   the amount of butter didnt bother me  but it did my whiny mother. Who whined even though there is a no whining sign as you walk in the door.   We ordered fresh cut fries as onion rings.  Both of which were great.  The half order was plenty and a nice option to a full order.   The restaurant was full of local men at lunch which is usually a good sign.  I give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of threw straws, silverware and napkins at us as she walked behind the counter.  At least she didn't throw the food when it came!   She also served the fries and Onion rings way before our burgers came out which was kind of weird.   They were nice and hot but would have been cold had we waited for the burgers.   It didn't factor into my four star rating but I deduct a star from nephew because he invited us out to lunch then allowed me pay!   Just kidding Justin!   Love ya! This is a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be: excellent breakfasts in huge portions for cheap. I had the western omlet and will be getting it or another omlet again soon\n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee was good, totally serviceable diner coffee. The waitress was wonderfully friendly and hopping around from table to table. The food was excellent. The ambience was exactly right for a diner. It was packed. The wait was not nearly as long as I was expecting. 10 minutes maybe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Totally recommended. Come hungry. Wow! Read the great reviews and I was not let down. Huge portions. The mixed grill was THE best breakfast I've ever had. If you go to Pittsburgh it is a must eat. Service was superb. Friendly staff. Led zeppelin on the walls. .....what else could you ask for? I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs, ham, toast, and home fries. Delicious as usual. The ambience however is usually lacking. The walls are dark, with writing and signatures of semi famous people all over the place. Pictures of local people hang on the walls(i secretly want mine up there) along with posters galore. While its fun to look at the first 10 times, it gets a little boring after awhile. So today when I arrived I expected the same old experience. Wow was I wrong! As soon as I looked at the door I knew something was different. The place seemed lighter and brighter. To my pleasant surprise, they painted and got new counter tops!! They're not quite done yet but the place has a new Happy vibe to it. The awesome breakfast, the new decor and the 5 guys sitting at the counter making me laugh are why I will be back( maybe for lunch). A gem. The coffee cups are mismatched . The owner is three feet away from me cooking. The sausage is made for them locally. And the food is frickin awesome. I had the pancakes, my daughter had the sausage and egg sandwich.  Cash only.  Friendly service. Excellent breakfast and lunch menu. Friendly staff and super food. Modest environment with excellent food. Worth the wait.. dont miss this one. \n",
      "Best breakfast and lunch food in the Pgh South Hills hands down. What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick, frankly and felt like I was with family. \n",
      "Fantastic poached eggs, Cajun homefries and crispy bacon. Gab and Eat is definitely a place I world recommend to locals. I was stuffed and the bill was only $8.00. A fine breakfast joint. You gotta love the small diners. Highly recommended. Barb's Country Junction gets a 5 star rating for me because it is truly everything that a Pittsburgh restaurant should be.  In addition to being the apple of my nostalgia's eye, it is also the constant thought of my tummy when I'm hungry on the weekends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Barb's breakfasts cannot be beat, but truly any meal you get there you won't regret.  Everything is made to order, with fair portions, and great prices. My recommendation is a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee.  There's nothing better than drinking from a cup that could have come from your grandma's kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know that Gab N Eat is nearby, and Barb's can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really is a gem of Carnegie that you've gotta try! Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here. This is a great place to eat and everyone is so friendly. I live right down the street from here but unfortunately, I have only gone a once. Trust me, I will go here more often. The food is great, prices are low, and the staff are friendly. My cousin and I wanted a place to eat and catch up and this was perfect place. I will go here more often. My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place, I really did...however, I didn't.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food was decent, some was above average and some below but it was overall decent. I got pancakes, bacon and eggs. The pancakes were really good and fluffy, the home fries were simply okay and the eggs were not cooked well. My son had a burger and it was good. The coffee at this place was brewed to perfection which a appreciate. I would give the food 3/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was subpar for sure. While our waitress was a really nice girl, she wasn't on top of anything at all. Had to ask for coffee refills, had to ask for silverware, for napkins...etc. She got the order messed up and so on. I give the service 2/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside of the place had some country charm as you'd expect but want particularly cleanly. It also had a leaky roof in several places which had buckets collecting the water. A customer even tripped over the buckets and fell. I give the interior 2/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prices were decent. I fed my whole family breakfast (3 of us) for $23. I give the prices 3/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "So in summary, you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it is not a great place to dine in by any means. There are better diners in the area that I will patronize in the future rather than Barb's. My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \"Seat Yourself\", but there were no signs stating this, so we stood there looking like fools for a minute. It took awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and I'm guessing that this was Barb. She apologized and said that one of her workers called off today. No big deal and her apology was appreciated. She came back with our drinks, dropped them off, and left again. We didn't see her for another 20 minutes. Ultimately, we were there for 30 minutes before she took our order. This was aggravating to me. I don't mind waiting for my food if I know it's going to be awesome and they're making it with love, but come on now. We ordered the hot pepper omelette/home fries/ toast and chocolate chip pancakes/sausage. The food was alright, really nothing special. A new waitress ended up taking care of us and she was much more attentive. We may or may not go back. For the price I ended up paying, this place was fine. There was a full kitchen, king bed and TV. I was just surprised at the lack of amenities at the hotel. While I have stayed at other extended stay hotels, I was surprised to find a sign in the room at this one stating that you only got your room cleaned once per week...if you wanted it more often than that you would have to pay for it. If you needed fresh towels, you'd have to go to the main desk to get them. They also only provided a small bar of soap in the room...not the typical soap, shampoo, lotion, etc. This didn't bother me too much as I was only staying a couple days but again I found it surprising not to have these basic things. \n",
      "\n",
      "The hotel in general was easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from. The hotel was clean and the people who worked there were very nice. Great value, close drive to city, not much to do around hotel, its a business park. Carnegie city has a few bars and restaurants. Simple\n",

      "My experience at extended Stay America was great. The staff was warm and friendly and made it a point to speak to me every morning as I left and when I returned in the evening. They went out of their way to provide A confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when needed. \n",
      "\n",
      "If I ever need to utilize an extended stay hotel I wouldn't hesitate to head back there. I've stayed at a couple of Extended Stay sites that I found quite satisfactory and this location proved to be just as good. Excellent place to stay while visiting Pittsburgh. It is just a five minute drive to downtown. Location is in a business park area so it is quiet. \n",
      "\n",
      "The rooms contain a nice kitchenette area with a full sized refrigerator, sink, cabinets and two burners. There is no oven which I expected as the descriptions all state \"full kitchen\" so be aware of that. Also they do not keep the dishes, pots and pans, coffee makers, toasters or utensils in the rooms. If you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in. \n",
      "\n",
      "The room was clean and well maintained. Cable tv quality is spotty sometimes but not intolerable. The free wifi is usually fast. \n",
      "\n",
      "The best part about this location was the staff. The people at the desk were all very pleasant and welcoming and quite willing to assist with any questions or issues with a smile.  I would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it. Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful I have said it on other sites and will repeat here. You MUST try their burgers. They are juicy and delicious with a bun that is perfect. Another must are the fries with Guinness gravy and if you haven't had enough go for the ultimate sleeper, Leek and potato soup. Authentic black & tans. Harp and Murphys on tap. It don't get no better. This is a true gem my friends. Be warned. Don't expect the best service ever. It's not the cleanest place you've been in either. The decor is soccer jerseys from places and teams you've probably never heard of. It's divey, eclectic, and authentic. \n",
      "\n",
      "If you're looking for good Irish food and a cold pint, you can't go wrong at the Pour House. Like most of Carnegie's Main St, this is a hidden gem worth seeking out. They have some of the best Irish food I've had in Pittsburgh- the colcannon is awesome and the shepherd's pie is out of this world. If you're not looking for Irish food, then try the grilled cheese- and make sure you ask it with the three cheeses together. It's big and the cheese is thick and gooey. I get it with a side of potato pancakes... Yum. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, they have Guinness, Smithwicks and Harp on tap... If I could give this place less than one star, I would. I have no idea who gave this place high reviews but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have sucked. The decor is tired and grimy, the place reeked of smoke, and the bartender/server was surly, to put it mildly. We went there on a Saturday night with a mind to try the Irish food. Apparently, we were out of luck. I've always thought that the secrets of restaurant success is to actually stock food for people to eat. He told us before we ordered that they had no \"pies\". No chicken pot pie, no shepherds pie, etc. So, we gamely tried to order other things. We placed our order. My wife, for example, ordered the Irish stew and he came back 5 min later telling us they were out of that and even more things for several people in our party. At that point my wife picked out a third option, ham and cabbage, only to be told again that \"they were out\". At that point, realizing that the only food to be had in the place was what was crusted on the menus, we asked to pay for our drinks and left. They actually then gave us flack for not having enough to put it on a debit card. In short, unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression, I'd probably avoid this place like the plague. Speaking of the plague, I suppose we should thank Mr. Surly for inspiring us to walk out. I only have two bathrooms at my house and would've been hard pressed to accommodate several violently ill people at once. Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest, nor the best decor.  But, that's not what this place is about.  It's a town Irish bar and it serves great solid Irish fare and suds to the locals.  And it does it better than anyone.  I go back again and again. Okay, so hopefully you haven't been enjoying happy hour @ Riley's Pour House before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilting Irish owners. \n",

      "To recap: Murphy's Pour House from 1979-1985. Sullivan's Pour House from 1995-2002. Paddy's Pour House from 2002-2012. And, bagpipe please, Riley's Pour House opens March 1 of 2012. Still with me?\n",
      "\n",
      "It's a tiny long bar just like the old Irish pubs. No more smoking allowed. Hurrah!!!  Same lousy service. \n",
      "\n",
      "My guess is that the entire place needs (no, strike that .... demands) an automated food/beverage ticketing system. None of the cooks, bartenders, or waitresses know who ordered what nor what ticket belongs to which table. It's actually pretty funny if you're not a) hungry or b) thirsty. \n",

      "\n",
      "I would call to complain, but based on the other reviews, its clear the owners do not care about Carnegie or it's residents, and its pretty well known around town just how awful their food is, so it would be pointless to boycott a place I'd never order from again anyway.\n",

      "if they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star **** Recommended. 16 inch pizza on special was cheap. Fast service. Not the best pizza but above average. Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through, and the sad attempt at cutting was so uneven that 4 of the slices were about an inch wide, while the others were about 4\" each. The toppings were scarce, they used mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza. The onions were huge chunks and the mushrooms were straight from a can. The worst part though was the thick doughy crust that tasted more like a fishy sourdough roll. I'm serious... It was so noticeable that it made me wonder if the dough was bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it. It was gross. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered steak and Italian hoagies. The veggies were old and wilted, and there was no dressing on either. The Italian had deli meat that was clearly bottom of the line and not very generous. The \"steak\" (if you an call it that) was greyish instead of brown and looked like it was a processed meat chopped into pieces. No flavor or seasoning and the texture was reminiscent of spam. It was so bad that I only ate 1/4 of it and tossed the rest. \n",
      "\n",
      "I have ordered from here in the past and always been disappointed. I thought I would give them another try since I'd never ordered a Sicilian pizza from there. What a mistake. I will never order from them again! Having certain businesses with skill sets in your local neighborhood is important.  I try to keep it as local as possible, so when I heard about a tailor in Carnegie I was intrigued.  The building is in a strip mall across from Carnegie Coffee Company.  Unassuming, looks like it is closed all the time, until you do a drive by and see the hours posted.  There is a Latino man in his 20's working when you arrive.  In my mind, I imagine a tailor to be older, kind of like my grandfather maybe with measuring tape around his neck (Textbook movie tailor), so I was a bit trepidatious about dropping off my clothing.  He asks you to go change into a closet (Yes, a closet to change in with one lightbulb) BUT all my worries aside, the moment he started working on my items I knew he was the real deal. He learned from his father at the age of 14 how to sew. and he does things the correct way.  Meaning, for example-  I took in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff, but he seamed them up to look EXACTLY the way they were when I first bought them.  Most placed will have bulges and puckers.  The rest of my items were just as perfect.  Very inexpensive at $10 for a pair of pants to adjust the hem.  The items were done in a timely manner.  He takes his business very seriously.  While I was there, I watched a lady rush in and demand 6 shirts to be altered in an hour, and he did it and charged the same price.  Really nice guy, please go and support this business to keep him around town! New to area and decided to pay this shop a visit! It was definitely the best experience I've ever had with a tailor. He is MUCH cheaper than the other shops, he charges 10 while others charge $15, and he goes above and beyond for what he charges.\n",
      "\n",
      "I dropped off 4 jeans, and he hemmed and tapered the jeans! I couldn't even tell the difference between the store bought jeans and the quality of his work. It was absolutely perfect, no bulges or puckers! They the match the exact stitch as the factory. \n",
      "\n",
      "Absolutely a great guy, they were all done and waiting for me as promised! I'll definitely be taking all of my business to this place, and would highly recommend to anyone who is looking for a personal tailor who actually cares about his work and building an honest business. I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready, the price was beyond reasonable and the work was EXCELLENT! I plan on bringing all my clothes to him from now on.\n",
      "\n",
      "Oh and he let me know that they also dry-clean. Wonderful shop! This is the best alteration place I have been to. The guy that owns it is extremely helpful and works FAST. Also, the prices are so reasonable I wonder how he stays in business. He was able to do an alteration on short notice and was very acommodating. The alteration I needed done--and fast--was right in the middle of prom season. All the other places I called gave me a several week wait, but he took me right away. I will be back! I just needed a broken zipper replaced on my favorite Penguins fleece jacket and a pair of suit pants hemmed.  The price was very reasonable and the work done was great.  I will go back for all my tailoring needs and highly recommend if you need any done. Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff, with extra fried stuff in a cardboard boat.  You will regret eating it 30 minutes after you finish, but it is delicious. I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. \n",

It's deep fried garbage....it's LOS c'mon what do you expect.....however I have never had better, friendlier service at a fast food restaurant. By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!! When I moved to the area, Dr. Weinberg was recommended to me by my cousin who had been a client for years. I've had nothing but positive experiences with her and her staff since seeing her two years ago. The team is professional, nice and courteous. I recently had to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they were very accommodating. My daughter looks forward to coming to the dentist so that's saying something. I DO wish they would turn off FOX news in the lobby as I'd rather watch paint dry but... nobody's perfect. In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.\n",

      "\n",
      "I recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door (furthest away from the parking lot) for the entrance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Poor recommendation because the staff who walked by me seemed to be distracted which was pointed out in a previous review. This is by far the best dentist I have ever been to.  She is honest and never trys to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need. We are very great full that we discovered her. We adjust our vacations to make sure that we stop in to her office in Pennsylvania at least once a year for cleaning and check ups, worth the drive from Florida. I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice, but I doubt her ability. Every procedure she has done to my teeth has backfired. The third and last issue I have is that i always paid cash at the end of my visits and somehow I have received an invoice for $55. I called and of course the receptionist was sassy and rude so I gave up. Will never go back or refer anyone else Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again, it's probably my favorite restaurant in Carnegie. Simple setup, just a small restaurant with a few tables and a TV. Oddly enough I think my favorite thing to eat there is the wonton soup, never had better. The food is average but I always enjoyed eating there, great service and a cheap place to get Chinese food. Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself. Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food. I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. \n",
      "\n",
      "The last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there, so be careful not to trip. \n",
      "\n",
      "The workers do seem like nice people just trying to make a living but when it comes to cleanliness Don Don is lacking. Delicious Singapore noodles and seafood delight. Crispy flavorful crab Rangoon, and cold sesame noodles done well (but could've used a bit more sauce). Excellent real Chinese food, friendly service.  Restaurant ambience: high school cheap date quality. I came here with two friends prior to visiting Apis Meadery next door this past weekend.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken, and my friends ordered the sesame chicken, crab rangoon, and another appetizer (egg rolls?).  They ordered the combo with less meat, and I ordered the one with more--the names were very similar, which I found confusing. The food took quite a while to come up (~15 min.), so I'd suggest calling ahead if you're in a rush.  While we were waiting, the woman behind the counter yelled at someone over the phone in Chinese, and then at a guy who came in to pick up food for delivery (probably the same person).\n",
      "\n",
      "To be honest, I'm not much of a fan of Americanized Chinese cuisine (I lived in Singapore for 3 mos. and have visited Hong King and Japan); it's been awhile since I've had it, and this dish reminded me why.  I don't care for the overbearing sweetness and thickness of the sauce, nor do I care for the pre-cut meat in the dishes (I like to cut up my own meat, thank you very much), so the flavors and textures don't do much for me.  Having said that, my friends claimed this was the best Americanized Chinese fare they'd had in PGH (and they live in Squirrel Hill!), so if you're a fan of this cuisine, you can take that into consideration.\n",

      "If nothing else, this meal provided us with some much-needed food to absorb the alcohol from the mead, which I appreciated. All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch, the place was freezing and loaded with kids toys! 2 bicycles, a scooter, and an electronic keyboard graced the dining room. A fish tank with filthy, slimy fingerprints smeared all over it is there for your enjoyment.\n",

      "Our food came... no water to drink, no tea, medium temperature food. Of course its cold, just like the room, I never took my jacket off! The plates are too small, you food spills over onto some semi-clean tables as you sit in your completely worn out booth seat. The fried noodles were out of a box and nasty, the shrimp was mushy, the fried rice was bright yellow.\n",

Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back. Went for breakfast on 6/16/14.

Food is always consistently great, and if you come at the right time, (witching hours) you may see the cook singing and dancing along with the music in the back. And it is awesome! ! Love this place!! I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh, and I find that this gym is not too far from me.  The staff is friendly, the equipment is quite good.  You get two free personal training sessions when you join.  They have lots of weights (which my boyfriend uses) and a decent cardio room.  The only thing I would say is to increase some of the cardio equipment.  Water is only $1 a bottle! I bought a three month membership last year, mainly to attend the Silver Sneakers classes. I was in my early sixties and hadn't exercised in a while. I tried the evening classes but they were very crowded and difficult, so I tried a morning class for seniors. I like to stretch out before my class actually starts, so I went to the tail end of a yoga class. The women in this class were very nasty to me and told me that I wasn't welcome to stretch out in their class. I never went back thanks to the attitude of the other members. I didn't feel welcome here. I complained to the manager, who said that I was welcome to stretch out in whatever class I wanted to, but the hostility of these yoga students was very evident. Do they think that this is their private gym? I really like this gym. It is nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they don't have big contracts and they have flexible memberships. Great selection of classes. All the instructors are very good knowledgable and motivating. All the staff working there are super nice. Their selection of the equipment is good too !! If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!! I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food, usually they drive places in east bumf*@ (tarentum, ligonier...) to get their capital I-talian.\n",

      "The first good sign Dad was happy was that he seemed impressed when it was open- it was noon a few days after Christmas. Second good sign was that Dad ordered wine, at it was only 1 pm. Dad, while not a teetotaler, rarely has a drink before 5 pm so I know he was anticipating a good meal. The kicker was that he was so happy he left our waitress a $20 tip on a $50 meal. \n",

      "Can I say, I live in Texas now and I still relive this afternoon back in December? I had chicken picatta...it was perfect. My dad had eggplant rollatini, my mom had a pizza, and my hubby had basic pasta and marinara. It all was amazing, delicous, and inexpensive. In Austin, you can't get a decent italian meal, much less a decent italian meal for under $50 for four people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I know there are so many good Italian places in Pittsburgh but I just think back so fondly on this day...when me Dad liked someplace I took him :) Papa J's is by far my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh, my hometown.  I eat there almost every time I visit, and everything I've ever ordered has been fantastic.  Fresh ingredients, simple preparation, reasonable prices.  Also, they make the best pizza in town HANDS DOWN. This is one of my husband's fave restaurants in town. My husband generally orders Chicken Parm, which is very good. Their sauce is quite good. They serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping -- yum.\n",
      "\n",
      " I generally order one of their house salads (think it has a specific name, but can't recall off the top of my head) which has mixed greens and I get it with blue cheese, pine nuts and their yummy vinaigrette. A tad pricey for a salad that's just lettuce and cheese (I want to say about $8 with the extras), but really good. (Especially with some cracked black peeper.) I tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the greens & beans. \n",
      "\n",
      "The place has sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side. It has a comfortable feeling. It also has a solid wine by the glass selection -- better than a lot of places in the 'burgh. \n",
      "\n",
      "Unfortunately, we've never had dessert there b/c we get so full of bread and dinner! Thanks yelpers for this find. The service, the plating, the ambiance were wonderful. I had the eggplant parmigiana and it was good - but different. It was thinly sliced (like deli meat) and wasn't breaded, it was fried in a very light batter. This place has been a favorite for 20 years since we returned from a trip to Italy having several weeks of fabulous fresh food, and couldn't think of any place we wanted to eat. Papa J's measures up to our expectations with great salads, bead and wine. I'm partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband likes samplers, ravioli, fish, white pizza. I like the space with exposed brick walls-there are knowledgeable servers. Sometimes it is a bit loud- more noticable when it is empty with a large table nearby. But don't get the wrong impression -it's a great place-consistantly great food. Great, authentic, classic Italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely places. \n",

      "\n",
      "Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer, which is great and goes really well with the FRESH and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal.\n",
      "\n",
      "For entrees, me and my girlfriend have had mixed experience.  I've had the fish sandwich (very good) and the eggplant parm sandwich (okay).  My girlfriend got the salad with bread and basil on it, but the basil was over powering and the bread was soggy with the dressing. \n",
      "\n",
      "The service is also a mixed bag.  The first time our server went out of her way to take care of us and even MADE me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich.  The second time, the server was lackluster, didn't know anything about the menu and wasn't able to take proper care of us.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would return to Papa J's, but I my terrible experience last time isn't enough to say it would be my first pick of places to eat around Carnegie/Robinson. I went there for dinner last night with a client.  This is second time I visited.  I had a scotch and he had a Guiness.  The (-1) is for drink selection. Just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and you're five stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with the meatballs covered with Provolone and other blessed goodness.  These did not disappoint.  I had a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic.  It was fantastic.  They have so many good dishes, but I wanted the pizza last night.  I couldn't finish the pizza - way to go big medium pizza.\n",
      "\n",
      "I finished up with a coffee.  The parking can be a bit of a challenge on the street, but it's a small town atmosphere in Carnegie, PA.  I love the downtown there. What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA, just south of Pittsburgh.  I was in town on business with a couple co-workers and after having a not so great meal the night before, we asked one of the locals for a recomendation.  They told us to try this little Italian place called Papa J's and boy did they send us to a great place.\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, when you walk up to the place, the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside.  You can stand outside and watch the chef making all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am not sure how long this place has been around but the kitchen looked well used, while the dining area as well as the bar looked very clean and modern, almost as if it had been freshly updated.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The server was quick to welcome us and suggested several different items off the menu as his favorites when asked.  The three of us were very hungry and wanting to try a few different things, so we began with a Margherita pizza which was absolutely perfect.  They obviously make their own breads and dough for the pizza and I don't think this pizza could have tasted any better.  Then came bowls of Italian wedding soup which was pretty good.  Of everything there, this was the one item I probably could have done without.  Not that it was bad, but there was nothing particularly special about it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "We also ordered the Garlic Rolls (not that the bread they already give you and the pizza was not enough carbs for 1 meal) and they were to die for.  Crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside, these things were a meal by themselves.  One of the guys with me said the pizza sauce would be good on them so he ordered a cup of the pizza sauce (which is fresh made there, not out of some can) and he was right.  As if these little killer bread balls with garlic were not good enough, dipped in the pizza sauce they were even that much better.  \n",
      "\n",
      "By the time our meals came, we were all pretty full, but we pushed on and continued to eat.  I had the Veal Parmigiano which was tender and very good.  It came with a side of pasta which I tasted just to try and it was excelent as well.  Had I not been eating a weeks worth of carbs in one sitting with all the pre-meal stuff, I certainly would have finished it.  As it was, I ate most but not all of the generous portion of veal.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One of my co-workers had the Chicken Picatta which he said was one of the best he had ever had and the other guy tried a pasta dish which he said was very good as well.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They had a great wine selection as well at reasonable prices by the glass or bottle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere.  I don't really know how expensive the area is for food, but coming from the Chicagoland area, I fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable.  The three of us ate very very well for an average of aproximately $30 each not including alcahol.  Fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price, who could ask for more.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that I had to return to Chicago and I am now craving to return to Papa J's.  I hope work sends me out here again sometime soon!!! Yay, I'm a fan but sometimes service is a little slow, it was very good for us this visit.  Go to Papa j's every once in a while but mostly for the White Pizza.  It is the best white pizza I have ever had.  Order the white pizza on our visit this  weekend... it has garlic, spinach, feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top.  It was delicious!  Order fried calamari and it was OK...note to self next time try the calamari roman style.\n",

      "The bar was jumping thou never go to the bar. Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all, a very crude and unpleasant dining experience for me and my guests.  Not to be repeated, never again! Yay, I'm a fan of the white pizza.  Had take out.  \n",

      "The bar was jumping when I picked up our order.\n",

      "The white pizza is so delicious...with garlic, spinach, feta, and added some veggies.  Tried the Roman Style calamari, very good better than the fried calamari we had last time. We met our good friends from Morgantown here for lunch today and were really impressed with the place itself and the menu. \n",

      "I had read a few of the reviews ahead of time and the pizza was mentioned more than once so by the time we got there, I was jonesing for it. \n",

      "Advice host that we are in a hurry.  The host advised us it is a 90 minute service. The place was crowded, we were seated at the last open table. However our waiter, Jason, said he will do his best to get as out on time. We ordered our dinner immediately, with a salad and a glass of wine. In a few minutes we had our wine, then in a few more seconds we had our salads and some great homemade Italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving. for dipping.  Yum!\n",
      "\n",
      "Just as we were finishing our salads our dinners were delivered. Great job Jason! The Fettuccine Carbanara was very good; a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta.  In and out in 60 minutes.  Now that is some good service. Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing, but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepared for giant serving. I had the carrot cake yummy!! Def a place everyone should try. I have to say that I write this review with much regret, because I have always loved PaPa J's. But my recent experience there has changed my mind a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "From the minute we were seated, we were greeted by a server that was clearly inexperienced and didn't know the menu. As I said before, I've been to PaPa J's a good handful of times so I know the menu decently well, but the server couldn't explain any of the questions I had about a couple new dishes I was thinking about trying. I swear this guy must have just looked at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "But it wasn't just the knowledge of the menu. It was one thing after another with our server. My wife asked for a glass of water 4 times until she finally got it (at which point the meal was over, so we didn't care at that point).  I mean come on, for a restaurant of this calibre and price is it too much to ask for a glass of water? There was no one filling up water.\n",
      "\n",
      "My biggest complaint, however, is what happened with our meals. My dad and I both ordered the trout special (trout with roasted red peppers and lump crabmeat). Instead, the meal that was delivered to both of us was trout with a heaping pile of spinach and mushrooms. Not what the special was at all.  And by the way, that item is on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake was made by the server (which, we are sure it was) or the chef, who knows for certain. Not to mention, though, that a good server wouldn't have served us that regardless. \n",
      "\n",
      "But before you think we had an unusal experience that was all due to a poor server, let me continue. When we informed our server of the mistake, he didn't really believe us until he checked his order sheet, and then he blamed the error on the chef. At this point, the meal had been sitting (because it took us forever to flag this guy down again) so the trout was basically cold. The server then said he would have the meals re-made. So, he took the meals back to the kitchen. Meanwhile, of course, my wife and mom are eating their meals and my dad and I are sitting there with no meals. Also keep in mind that my wife still had not gotten the water she had been asking for, and my iced tea had been refilled with a soda (yes, believe that or not). All the kitchen did was scrape their \"mistake\" off of our fish! They didn't remake anything. Our fish was served to us again with little pieces of spinach and mushrooms sticking all over it. Quite frankly, the fish wasn't good at all. I honestly would have rather had a fish sandwich from McDonald's that night. The server never did anything to try to make our experience better - he knew we weren't happy, but never offered anything such as dessert on the house. I'm not looking for a handout, but our experience was just plain awful that night. The guy never really even apologized for the mistake. Normally, I may have asked for a manager, but at this point I was ready to just get out of there (plus, we had to be somewhere else that night).\n",
      "\n",
      "My opinion... for the money, there are many other restaurants I would rather eat at. This is a regular go-to for me. I love the food and the service. They always have the wine that I like and the food is always delicious. I suggest trying the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store (in the section where you can buy stuff to take home). It is sublime and makes you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness. I thought the interiors were very nice.  We stopped here on a Friday night & I was glad they weren't busy because nothing else in the area looked appetizing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "My daughter & I split a chicken parm sandwich, which was really good. Instead of it being served on a hoagie, it was served on thin bread- like focaccia or something.  It was pretty good- little messy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The desserts looked amazing.  I thought it was pretty cool how you can watch the cooks prepare the food from outside.  The kitchen is situated on a corner with lots of windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "I would return. san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice. Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables, the decorations, the menu.  All the same.  Does that make you a little worried?  Yes.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the mushroom ravioli and it was... oily.  Very very oily.  The actual ravioli was okay, enough mushrooms.  but it was oily.  Did I mention that?  \n",
      "\n",
      "Ambiance, like I said, left much to be desired.  I don't think I'd have this place on my list of \"musts\" for downtown.  Much better restaurants to visit! Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night, the restaurant was full but not crowded.  We were seated in a room with poor acoustics.  It was difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress.  While she tried, I can see the asperation in her face when she had to repeat the specials to both sides of the table.\n",
      "\n",
      "People ordered bourbon on the rocks before dinner which seemed watered down, while my lemon drop was made nice.  The bread was delicious!  Can you describe it to be creamy?  The fried zucchini was lightly breaded and not too oily.  It was a large portion made up of 2 sliced zucchinis.\n",
      "\n",
      "We ordered a variety of dishes.  The pasta dish was dry with more pasta than sauce or meat.  Those who ordered the fish special thought it was delicious.  The shrimp dish was enjoyed as well.  I had the chicken marsala which was pretty good.  The marsala sauce wasn't too thick, and the chicken moist.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hard to tell if the deserts were \"homemade.\"  The tiramisu and spumoni were small in portion and meant for one. \n",
      "\n",
      "On the whole, I was on the fence with my overall impression of Papa J's.  \"A-ok\" probably is the best way to describe it. Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \"just\" working . They have nice decor,nice bar and good bread. Consider where this place is ,the prices are really really high . Nothing is served on the side with main dishes .... Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood Great place for dinner, drinks or a small celebration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Papa J's is one of my favorite go to places for dinner when we don't have reservations and want a nice dinner out. My husband and I have eatten here upwards of 20 times over the last few years and have never been disappointed. I assumed that when they opened the alternate bar with lounge area and extra tables for dining on the other side of the resturant that  the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy. I have been proved wrong.  We are always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes. Unfortunately, the alternate bar/lounge area isn't always open. I really don't understand why more people don't go here. \n",
      "My favorites are the fried zucchini, wedding soup and pizza.The zucchini is always crispy and seasoned well. The wedding soup has big chunks of carrots and celery. My husband also enjoys the pork entrees especially the grilled pork and the pastas including the tomato cream sauce. Also, their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip is a great way to wet your appetite. Make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, if you are looking for a good place to host a birthday party or event, consider Papa Js. They have a great catering menu and are easily able to accomodate larger parties. We had our rehersal dinner for our wedding here and everyone loved the food. Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room, right by a door where clinking pots /pans and  dishes were heard throughout our meal, as well as a Darth Vader type noise coming from the ceiling vent. Our waitress was not knowledgable of all menu items, and three of our  very simple requests did not come out as ordered. ( dressing on the side of a salad,  less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree) The waitress blamed it on the cook, but did offer to get one entree changed. Also we were asked if we wanted pine nuts, feta or Gorgonzola on our salad and then were charged 2.00 extra per item in addition to the salad price (6.99) which brought the salad up to 10.99 ! Outrageous !\n",
      "There is so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant , but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere. I will most likely not return. Very overpriced for the quality and service. Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie. Very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price.  We had a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends. The waitress was very efficient , but not very friendly. Our orders came out hot and excellently prepared!  Try the tilapia milanese , it's excellent. Best steamed broccoli Iv'e ever had. I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window, that opened the whole lounge bar area to the street.  It had modern furnishings and the staff were quite friendly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ordered the quattro formaggi pizza.  Quite good!!!  Great balance of cheeses.  Not too rich at all.  Crust was excellent too.  Can't wait to come back. Just to start off, we were a party of 12, which is always a little difficult.  We were celebrating 2 birthdays.\n",
      "\n",
      "We LOVED the food, it was delicious. My husband got a chicken parm sandwich, which is served on a yummy flat bread, and I got the chicken basil pizza ( i got an 8 cut and several ppl tried it) we all LOVED it! It was stunning.  It was made with a very delicious crust, nice and crisp, not soggy (like pesto pizza can get)\n",
      "\n",
      "The one waitress we had JASMINE, was fantastic!  She was bright, friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu.  She took extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections... \n",
      "\n",
      "Now... the other waitress.. Mary something was so incompetent...  She was awful and rude.  She missed 2 people on that side of the table failed to take their order and when we said something she said 'well they didn't speak up!' Ugh.  Then when it was time to sing and cut the cake, my sister in law said 'oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing?'  She came back, cut the cake (all crazy with some huge pieces and some super small pieces like she never in her life cut a sheet cake) and we didn't even sing!  We were mad!!\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is so pretty, they have a new addition that was just built within the last 2 years (according to my father in law) and its really nice.  They look to have a cool bar area with some modern couches and a really sweet look.   \n",
      "\n",
      "So good food, great looking place.. one bad waitress. Prices are about middle of the road for an authentic Italian place, nothing crazy.  All in all, we'd like to go back again, but we want Jasmine! I am amazed that people can write negative reviews about Papa J's.   I have been a return customer since the early 90's and the food quality, and service, are way above average......and especially for this price range.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kudos to management for maintaining such a level of quality and freshness.   Nothing we had tonight was disappointing, and we over-ordered because each dish was delectable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The best item tonight was the Mozzarella appetizer \"cradled\" in Bread with an authentic marinara.\n",
      "\n",
      "The white pizza with sun-dried tomatoes was, as usual, out of this world good.   The scallops special appetizer was phenomenal.\n",
      "\n",
      "WE WILL BE BACK. Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly, rude and unhelpful..  Decided to try it again since it is close to Stage 62.  Big mistake.  Greeted by a dour manager that seemed mad that we had a reservation. 30 minutes to get a glass of wine.  At one hour and 45 minutes complained to the manager that we still had not received out entrees.  He said 'What do you want me to do about it?\" and said they had a busy night.  This is when tables around us sat empty. I then had to go back to the manager to give us our bill so we could get away from this ruined evening.  The bill was prepared incorrectly. If you want average food and terrible service, this is your place.  We will never go back. The menu has lots of choices and the food is great! The Resturante has been expanded so it's pretty large. The new section has door that they leave open during nice weather which makes for a nice ambience! The bread is great and fresh baked daily! I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense, how could we order when the waitress wasn't coming to the table? After arguing with me he ended up taking $6 off of our $200+ bill. Ridiculous. If it were up to me I would have never returned. Unfortunately my family decided to go here again tonight. Again it took a long time to get our food. My food was cold and bland, my kids food was cold. My husbands salmon was burnt to a crisp and my sister in law took one bite of her trout and refused to eat any more because she claims it was so disgusting. The wedding soup and bread were good, but that's it! My drink sat empty throughout my meal and never got refilled even when I asked. Bad food, slow service and rude managers. I'll pass on this place if my family decides to go again. Not worth it at all with all the other good Italian options around. Delicious!  Everything I've ever had here was great!  The white pizza is a MUST!  Always amazing!  I'm also a big fan of the chicken piccatta.  The bread that they bring to the table is delicious too!  They have a wide variety of selections on the menu and they also have nightly specials that always sound great!  Their prices are also reasonable.  Overall, I highly recommend this place! 2nd times a charm. This place was 3.5 starts the first time I came, but stepped up large tonight.  Waitress was righteous and very fun.  Food was all excellent.  Caesar salad tasty--got with tomatoes big $ on that, fettuccini carbornara with bacon n smoky cream flavor.  Can't wait for the leftovers!!  The white pizza is that star though.  The crust/dough is heavenly and the flavor is top shelf.  I don't throw those accolades out easily, especially on pie, but this joint serves it up.  Good vibe, great service, phenomenal food.  Ill be back. Service was great. Apps delish, specifically the stuffed banana peppers & lentil with ham soup. I think I chose the wrong entree though because I ordered a cod with crabmeat special. The cod was completely tasteless with some crabmeat layed across the top. It all reminded me of boiled fish. Yuck! Note to self. Order the pasta! I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly, as well. spinach/feta cheese salad:  B-\n",

      "ARRIVE EARLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT THIS PLACE PACKED after 6pm It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back. We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall, as it was fairly busy that night. In the short time that he was there, a man who was behind the bar looked at him and then turn away without saying a word or notifying anyone else. He then turned to a waitress who had approached the service area of the bar and asked her if  we could have a server take our drink order. She said \"yep\" and then abruptly turned and walked away. At that point, he asked to see the manager  who came a few minutes later. When my friend told him of what had occurred, the manager said \"What do you want me to do\"?\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend said \"An apology would be a good start\" whereupon the manager looked back at him and said \"Get out and don't come back\" ???????? Are you kidding????\n",
      "\n",
      "My friend is well traveled and frequently stays at higher end hotels and dines at quality restaurants. He was not screaming or belligerent in any way, shape, or form; simply informing the manager of what had occurred. \n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, we left and went back to 131 East, where we had previously eaten. The service there was fabulous, as was the meal and the drinks creative and exquisite.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are new restaurants that have opened in Carnegie as of late. Papa J's is no longer the only game in town.  Obviously this is the way a simple complaint is handled by management. Appalling!!  Do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that are within walking distance of Papa J's. They understand the concept of  customer service. Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great. Finally, great Tuscan-style Italian food in Pittsburgh, not that tasteless stuff that locals think is Italian.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bread was warm and fresh. The bolognese sauce was creamy and rich, and unlike most restaurants was made with veal. I love the fresh smell of baking bread throughout the restaurant.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm looking forward to working my way through the menu of chicken options, and next time, I'm saving room for dessert! The display of cakes and pastries at the door was amazing. Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine, I felt downright robbed at the $50 price tag.  Seriously, I could have easily made what we had with jarred sauce and boxed pasta at home. Classico is better.  And the service was pretty absent to make it even worse... seemed she knew it was terrible and didn't want to deal with it.  Seriously, I'd rather eat at the OG. Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh. Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible, thin and flabby and rather unappealing. The pasta itself was ok, as was the sauce. The desserts are pretty good. But honestly, that is a $10 dish whose price has been inflated. I'm up in the air about how I feel regarding Emmert Dental. Being that it is located in Market Square can be both a good or bad thing. Parking is scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurants and coffee places around you. The office itself is old and raggedy looking but the staff are young and hip. I think possibly a little too young and hip. My dentist knew what she was doing but I didn't adore her. I'm still working out my bill because they charged me too much on my copay and don't really seem to have all their info. together. After a cleaning and fillings, I think I'm going to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work done... I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional, rude and have no clue what they're doing (behind the desk). I will not be going back nor will I have nice things to say about them. THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam, I needed 3 additional root canals and an extraction! An extraction on the tooth that just had a root canal. I was told that part of the tooth had broken off and that a crown was no longer possible.  I didn't know any better, so I agreed to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later. The \"dentist\" wanted to extract it that day, but I had plans for the weekend and was not about to be in pain. So, 2 weeks later, I went in for the extraction.  After they gave me novocaine they get me with \"you need a bone graft also in that area since we are extracting that tooth\". I have never had any issues with bone loss with previous extractions so I didn't feel it was necessary. I had 3 employees surrounding me, pressuring me for this bone graft. So, I reluctantly agreed. I had to pay $259.00 for this \"bone graft\". So, I signed everything. I wasn't even given enough time to read the document, so I should have known and got up and left right then and there. The \"dentist\" started the extraction. I have never been so uncomfortable in my life. He pulled on my tooth, used a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and was pulling so hard that my head was coming up and slamming back down against the head rest.  Finally, after a good 15 minutes of this torture, he ripped the tooth out of the side of my jaw. I was literally ganging from all the blood running down the back of my throat. He then stuck some pink powder up in the extraction area. I'm assuming this was the bone graft.  I ended up with many stitches. I was given an antibiotic and instructed to schedule an appointment for the following Saturday so they could start the bridge. Then I was hit with a bill of $569.00! My insurance covers 100% of extractions.  I was in so much pain for 2 weeks following the extraction. Pain severe enough that I had to call off work and I couldn't sleep at night.  I refused to go back to Emmert Dental.  And after a visit to a very reputable dentist, an endodontist and an oral surgeon, I have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage Emmert Dental has done to my mouth.  They caused a very large deformity in my jaw and I am at risk to lose additional teeth.  Save yourself a lot of time, money and pain.  Emmert dental only cares about the money, will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work.  They are butchers and should not even call themselves dentist. And if you have an issue with their billing practices, don't expect to that resolved easily.  I have called numerous times and I am always told that the manager and or billing department is not in.  I have contacted the BBB and a lawyer.  I expect and want a full refund.  No one should have to go thru what I am currently going thru.  They do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant.  Now I have to go thru oral surgery, more pain and suffering and more time missed from work because of Emmert Dental.  And the root canals they said I needed, my current dentist and my endodontist both agreed that I do not need tooth canals.  In fact, the teeth are perfectly healthy.  They are crooks and butchers. The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time. Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible, the staff seem to be generally clueless, the management is inclined to blame the staff for their own mistakes, and there's no sense of FAST in their fast food. When we came, half of the menu board was still on breakfast, and it was 4:30p. The only thing they have going for them is that the food is hot and tastes just like McDonald's should. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then again, the franchise is owned by Rice, and I've come to take terrible service is their MO. My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!\n",
      "The cashier took my friends's order, then promptly ignored me. I had to force myself in front of a cashier who opened his register to wait on the person BEHIND me. I waited over five minutes for a gigantic order that included precisely one kid's meal. After watching two people who ordered after me be handed their food, I asked where mine was. The manager started yelling at the cashiers for \"serving off their orders\" when they didn't have their food. But neither cashier was anywhere near those controls, and the manager was the one serving food to customers and clearing the boards.\n",
      "The manager was rude when giving me my order. She didn't make sure that I had everything ON MY RECEIPT, and never even had the decency to apologize that I felt I was getting poor service.\n",
      "I've eaten at various McDonalds restaurants for over 30 years. I've worked at more than one location. I expect bad days, bad moods, and the occasional mistake. But I have yet to have a decent experience at this store. It will remain a place I avoid unless someone in my party needs to avoid illness from low blood sugar. Perhaps I should go back to the racially biased service of Steak n Shake instead! I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Today was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise, like I really woke her up or something. She said,\"Youre the one who ordered the iced coffee? I can get it for you!\" For real? She was the one who took my order! I told her I waited too long and I just want my money back. The manager offered to make my iced coffee, but  I refused because I had just had enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are *few* employees there who work hard but everyone else is dragging their feet. There is no organization or teamwork, everyone is scrabbling. It looks like none of them want to be there. I used to work in fast food and I know it sucks, but come on!\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm sorry but I can't recommend this Mcdonalds. It's poo. I'm not coming back here anymore. Guess I'll be going to Starbucks- and their iced coffees taste better anyway! This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Order:  Big mac, large fries, diet coke.\n",
      "\n",
      "The soda machine was broken.   No sodas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then I got to the window.  \"We rang you up for medium fries.\"   (Not what I asked for)  \"Well, if you want a large, you're gonna have to wait 4 minutes.  We just started a new batch.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Left with:  Big mac, medium fries, no coke.\n",
      "\n",
      "Actually, now that I think about it, this was one of my better experiences there... We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. \n",
      "\n",
      "One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, which according to the menu description, should've had lettuce and tomato in it. But the sandwich that arrived on our table had none of those ingredients. When pointed out to the waitress, she just brought some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate! How crude! \n",
      "\n",
      "Spoke to the manager after paying the full check and first of all, she did not even offer to re-imburse for the item we did not even order, and that had been forcibly thrust upon us. \n",
      "\n",
      "When I asked the manager about the Buffalo Chicken sandwich not having any lettuce and tomato, she said they just got new menus and that description is not correct and that Buffalo Chicken Sandwich is supposed to be without lettuce and tomato! What a lame excuse! Even your online menu says under the description for a Buffalo Chicken sandwich that its supposed to have both those ingredients - \"Served with lettuce and tomato on a fresh-baked Kaiser roll.\" - That's what the last line in the description of Buffalo Chicken Sandwich says. Shame on you Manager for lying! Instead of admitting her fault, she was blaming it to a new menu!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not only did we have to pay for something that we didn't order or eat, but we got sub-standard food that was different from what was described in the menu, and had to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am never going to come back to any Eat N Park location ever again, and will never recommend one to any of my friends either. What a waste of time and money! Plus dealing with callous and lying people - my goodness, I surely had my patience tested this evening! This company represents a honest and caring company that cares about their community.  They operate a variety of businesses and restaurants including the Eat n Park locations, the new Porch in Shenley, Six and Penn Kitchen, and the new upcoming Hello Bistro.  I cannot wait to try all of their dinning places. They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. \n",
      "\n",
      "Well it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said, \"They burned your fish, so I had them put two new pieces in the oven.\"  I was impressed by his honesty and didn't mind waiting for two new pieces.  \n",
      "\n",
      " I gladly helped myself to my boyfriend's french toast while I waited. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then out of no where another server comes to the table with the burnt fish and sets it down infront of me. With the burnt side down of course.  That just shows the kitchen is not in total coordination.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Like I said getting fish from Eatn' Park is a toss up. In the end I got two nicely baked pieces of sole to replace the burnt ones, so I left satisfied. Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable, the smiles and laughter is always there.  How can I stay mad when the prices or so cheep? Myself my boyfriend and his nephew had lunch with milkshakes and me having a coffee it was $31.00\n",
      "\n",
      "On this particular occasion the fire alarm went off and rang and rang and rang loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department got there realized they didn't have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it off...only at Eatn' Park.\n",
      "\n",
      "My baked potato was hard as a rock, I had ordered two pieces of baked cod and only received one. \n",
      "\n",
      "The waitress was very sweet and attentive and really attempted to build a rapport with our lil nephew which I thought was sweet. This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this (although cute) makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave. Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. \n",
      "\n",
      "Starbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy, cool and upscale their establishments are I can't get around the yicky tasting bitterness of Staryucks regular coffees. Talk about over roasting a bean...Maybe something has changed with their regular coffee but I have not drank it in about a year. I am not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff. Still I'll give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso is acceptable and doesn't taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean. Friendly staff, same starbucks fair you get anywhere else.  Sometimes the lines can get long. Mmm...peppermint mocha\n",
      "\n",
      "In my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area. Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: \n",
      "\n",
      "1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty, compared to the other Starbucks I have been in.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. If you have to use the bathroom, they give you a key thats attached to this nasty bottle. Im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Aside from that, good coffee and fast/friendly service. If there was ever a \"get your coffee and go\" Starbucks, this is it. Right in the center of the Waterfront, this Starbucks has no sofa, comfy chairs, only table seating. I love the baristas here, But I don't like the location of the building. This is a typical Starbucks. The coffee is good but the store is suprisingly dirty. I have to agree with Joe on this one.  The baristas are extremely friendly, and the service is great, but the fact that there are no comfy chairs or couches is very unwelcoming.  I do think however that the building is beautifully ans strategically located in the center of the shopping.  I just wish they had better seating. I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well, in my world recently because it's been a while since I've been here.\n",
      "\n",
      "They've added more seating which makes it way more conducive to having a meeting here. Which is my concern during the week. I imagine during the weekend it just fills up with tweens getting their sugar rush before hitting the movie theater. \n",
      "\n",
      "The coffee, or tea for me.. Is still same old same old. I don't imagine one single Starbucks will break the mold and make original drinks... Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff. Regarding quality of beverage, this is just your average Starbucks. I can't complain but am not blown away either. However, I really like the location of this shop, which is located in the center of The Waterfront's specialty retail shops. Though in the midst of a lot of retail, the surrounding area is very picturesque with pretty green grass, flowers, and a fountain. Hanging out here is very relaxing. I love the location of this Starbucks, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. It's right smack in the middle of clothing stores, the Loews movie theater, as well as restaurants. I love grabbing a mid afternoon latte here on a Saturday while perusing various stores such as the Gap or Loft. I also like coming here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt.\n",
      "\n",
      "While the drinks are the same as you would find at any Starbucks, the baristas and staff are really friendly, perhaps more so than other area Starbucks. \n",
      "\n",
      "My drink or choice when I come here generally in the mod afternoon is a venti (or trenta...) berry hibiscus refresher. Yum! It is the perfect afternoon pick-me-up that leaves me feeling refreshed and hydrated. This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!\n",
      "\n",
      "Seating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.\n",
      "\n",
      "Baristas are friendly and fast. As far as Starbucks go, this is a pretty nice one.  The baristas are friendly and while I was here, a lot of regulars must have come in, because they bantered away with almost everyone.  The bathroom was clean and well maintained and the trash wasn't overflowing in the canisters around the store.  The pastries looked fresh, but I didn't partake.  The noise level was also at a nice working level - not too loud, music just barely audible.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do wish there was more seating.  It is nice that this location has a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers, but it doesn't replace more tables.  I'm sure this isn't as much of a problem in the summer when there's the space outside.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was a treat receipt promo going on, but the barista didn't tell me about it, which I found odd.  Usually when they have promos like that going on, they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer is.  Today it was one of their new pastries for $1, I know in the summer they do $2 grande iced drinks with that morning's receipt.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, nice working or socializing environment.  Very friendly and inviting.  It's what I've come to expect from Starbucks, so points for consistency. I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small, alley-like front makes it difficult to get past people on your way to/from the bathroom or tables when it's busy. And there's hardly any tables to sit at. Furthermore, people tend to clog the front on their way in, which makes things particularly difficult (especially in the winter weather). The staff were pretty impersonal to be, but maybe that was due to the high traffic of the place and the time I was there. And the coffee that I had was cold- I'm sure it was probably the bottom of the batch. I'd probably only walk in here again if someone else suggested it before or after a movie or while we were shopping in the area. This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience, kindness, generosity and fairness. I left that afternoon loving Starbucks even more than when I went in. It's great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers are to them. I am always so pleased with the customer service here. For such a tiny Starbucks, the do a really great job serving the masses that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy. \n",
      "\n",
      "Outdoor seating in the summer is nice. For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er, this store can seem vast and confusing.  There's rows and rows of baskets and bedazzling jewels and paper and...oh my...scrap booking!  When I want to find boring old felt....it's like...where do I start?  \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm in a hurry, as always, and I rush in and the first thing I look for is an employee.  No one to be found.  I could call out and my voice would come echoing back.  I run between rows of paper, wood and gosh darn scrap booking....no felt!  Where do I find felt!  Where do I find an employee!?\n",
      "\n",
      "FINALLY, I find one after 15 minutes of wondering around.  She's incredibly nice and leads me to the felt.  This is not the first time I've been hard up to find help.  I tell her she was hard to find, and she tells me that they're \"low on payroll\" and can't have any one the floor BUT HER!  In that WHOLE store, JUST HER!  That's ridic!\n",
      "\n",
      "Not a month ago I was, again, in a slight hurry and stood in line for about 15 minutes to check out, with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line, I gave up and walked out.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Hey Michael, do you pick up what I'm putting down?  You're not making any money because your costumer service SUCKS....in fact, there's no service to be found! I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store, but it's not a small store -- just average.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do enjoy using the Michael's coupons when shopping. I definitely save a lot of money! Instead of toting around the paper versions, I actually have the iPhone app that has coupons available to use from the app. \n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint is that sometimes it takes a while to check out at this location. I don't normally have a problem - usually only one or two people ahead of me - but sometimes it can be much slower. Today, for example, there were only two customers ahead of me, but one of them was having issues with a coupon. The line began to get longer and longer, and though a couple associates were lingering up front, they kept calling for someone else. From personal experience of being a manger in a retail store, do not linger or let your associates linger near the cashiers without jumping on register. Whatever the reason may be that you are not helping customers, it still appears rude and make everyone more impatient.... It's your typical chain craft store.  And let me reiterate that I'm not a crafts person. I walked in because I needed dial rods for some signs I had. Now for being a chain store I was a bit upset because even though they had a decent selection, the amounts they had for each one I wanted were scarce.  Imagine me standing there with different sizes of wood in my hand and just staring in disbelief.  And for a piece of wood, the price was a bit steep.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will provably come back here, but only for an item that I cannot find elsewhere. Or if I'm too lazy to drive further out. It's yet another Michael's, and it's a very good one. Recommended always. For those who love crafting, Michael's is a godsend. I come here pretty frequently for art and craft supplies. Whatever Michaels doesn't have I just order online from a different retailer. Some items are pricey but you can still find some good deals. If you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interesting clearance items. Customer service is average. My favorite time to visit Michaels is when summer is about to end and all the fall and Halloween items are set out. Since I come here often, I know where everything I need is. However, the store could use a new layout. The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork, painting, knitting, kids crafts, scrapbooks, you name it. The problem is, the variety of products for your particular craft is probably dismal. They've got lots of cool items all over the store that you're convinced that somehow you need. (Because it is soooo cute, and you could TOTALLY do something with it. Right..?) The store feels cluttered because there is so much stuff everywhere. However, if you're looking for something specific, good luck. It's not even a matter of the product being difficult to find in the store. It's that when you find the right section, there's either nothing in stock, or they simply don't even carry what you need. \n",
      "\n",
      "I stopped in for crochet supplies, and the yarn selection was laughable compared to many other craft stores. I ended up going elsewhere for my stuff anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "Plus the prices at Michael's are significantly more than other area craft stores. I usually only stop there if I'm already at tend Waterfront. I'd recommend checking other craft stores first. Unless you need glitter. Especially fine glitter. Michael's has the best glitter selection/quality of any store I've ever been to. You would think their exorbitant prices would at least buy some decent customer service. Not at this location. \n",
      "\n",
      "They are totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or willing to help you find anything. This is a problem because they carry so many completely different products that it's hard to find what you need. Expect to wait at least a half hour before getting assistance.\n",
      "\n",
      "The organization is disjointed, especially depending on your project. There's even a section called \"art supplies\". I thought that was kind of the point of the whole store. \n",
      "\n",
      "What did it in however was how miserably they packed my picture frames. The place next door wrapped two dollar drinking glasses in paper to protect them, but apparently Michael's thinks a grocery bag is sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, the inevitable happened and I dropped the bag. Now I don't expect every place to be sympathetic, even though it could have been packed better, but when I asked for a refund they were down right RUDE. Hey I did drop the thing, but some empathy would have been nice. I wasn't completely out of line asking because a little bubble wrap and it would have been fine in the first place. I will never be back to this or any other Michael's. Whenever I was at the waterfront I would eat here.  The shakes are good, as are the shoestring fries and baked beans.  The sandwiches are small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double.  Overall, pretty tasty. The food is good and its CHEAP.\n",
      "\n",

      "Long story short, my food never came... the waitress told me (after I had been sitting there waiting for thirty minutes) that the kitchen hadn't even started on my order yet, so I told her to cancel it and walked out. Now I see that others on Yelp have warned about the slow service at this location. Wish I had looked it up earlier. I heart Steak N Shake. I love the fact that the fries are shoestring, the burgers get to you pretty fast, they're a little greasy, and the food is super cheap.\n",

      "I visited Steak and Shake on New Year's Eve in preparation for an evening of mostly tame partying. I was unnaturally attracted to their Wisconsin Buttery Burger, which is a double patty cheeseburger topped with grilled onions between two buns that have been buttered. Sounds good right?\n",

      "Well, I get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns had been dunked in butter. The pearly gates of cholesterol laden heaven with the triglyceride angels were singing to me.  I took the liberty of increasing my sodium intake by pouring their burger/fries seasoning on the buns and I literally got tears in my eyes....most likely from the salt overload, but possibly because this was one of the most evilly decadent things I had eaten in a long time.\n",

You never know what kind of quality or service you're going to find here.  A friend and myself went a few weeks back after a movie and it had to be one of the worst trips there EVER!  You can't entirely blame the waitress since she was the only one there for the entire place...poor scheduling on the manager's part. However, while she can't be accountable for the slooooow service, she was accountable for both orders being incorrect.  The burgers were over cooked and the fries were soggie and the milkshake was runny at best...\n",

      "By far my worst visit to Steak n' Shake! Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason, 25 minutes, I realized cooked to order but this is a little long for SnS.  Ordered the Guacamole Steakburger and it only had a small portion of Gauc...not your usual amount..kitchen was not up to speed on portion sizing for some reason.  Definitely did not look like the picture on the website.  Oh well! Ah, Steak n Shake, you hit the spot after a night of drinking. Open 24 hours, drive thru or dine in, with wonderful, cheap greasy burgers, chicken fingers, breakfast sandwiches, and shoestring fries. You're faster (and cheaper!) than Eat N Park. Plus your employees wear those adorable bow ties. Granted, if we were at a fancy party, I might act like I don't know you, but deep down inside you know I heart you. The only thing worse than the food is the service. Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we, and another party walked out without even being greeted properly, I observed several employees traipse out the front door, several tables who were waiting for their food for a long time,  several employees just standing around out of direct view of the tables, a morbidly obese hostess that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other. I think one server was high. \n",

      "  Going there was a  special request by a 7 year old getting over a long-ish illness, so that makes the shabby treatment more enraging. This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo. I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service. Fast food done right, what more can you want?\n",

      "I ordered the western BBQ burger, which was 2 thin patties, cheese, bacon, BBQ sauce, and fried onions. It came with shoe string fries (my favorite), all for the low price of $4.79. Are you kidding me? What's not to like! The food was actually pretty good! I liked it a lot. Since it was happy hour I also \"splurged\" on a chocolate covered strawberry shake. It was meh. Could have gone without it. The overpowering taste of artificial strawberry really turned me off, but the hot fudge saved it. But, how can you really go wrong with hot fudge?\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all, 3 meals and 3 shakes came to $20. A steal. Also the food is good! I enjoyed it. I'd come back. Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed. The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen, the waiters and waitresses are often very apologetic for the long waits and it's pretty obvious that some of them avoid the tables after taking the initial order to avoid hearing complaints. Food is good, what you'd expect from Steak n Shake. THE SERVICE IS AWFUL. so incredibly awful. expect to take at least an hour for your meal, even when it's slow. I've been going here for years when I want a cheap meal, but the service is so so so awful. Go to McDonalds. The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check, never checked to see if my drink needed refilled, she just mopped the floors. \n",

      "The burger was really greasy, the fries were Luke warm and the cheese on them wasn't as flavorful as it should be. As a new Pittsburgher I'm not impressed. I should have known better than to stop here, but I was nursing a hangover and just wanted something quick and simple.  I should kick myself for thinking of this place.\n",
      "\n",
      "Granted I decided to go to the drive thru and knew there would be a wait.  The sign actually says that the food is prepared when you order it.  I sat for almost ten minutes at the window while my food was prepared.  During that time I wished I could have taken back my order and also wished that I hadn't paid already.  \n",
      "\n",
      "While sitting at the window I decided to just stare inside and watch some of the employees doing their job.  What disturbed me the most was watching the employee making the milkshakes.  Making a milkshake isn't that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch.  What disgusted me was that the guy actually lifted several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them.  I mean smelt them to see if they were clean, instead of actually taking the extra minute or two to clean the container.  After witnessing this my food was finally ready and I drove away.\n",
      "\n",
      "When I finally got to eating my food I was underwhelmed.  The fries had no flavor and with the size of the cut it appears you get more than what you ordered.  The \"steakburger\" really, they should just call it a burger, was overpowered by the BBQ sauce on it.  It was all I could taste.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this has cemented me in not wanting to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again. Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin, but crispy. They aren't bad. The prices are also quite decent. However, their shakes are amazing. Thick and creamy. It's also great that they have half off shakes on weekdays in the early morning like 1-3am. You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality, and about two rungs down in quickness. At least, you think you know. \n",
      "\n",
      "I used to have a small place in my heart (though the salt and fat weren't very kind to said organ) for Steak N Shake, because hey, who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream? But after my last trip, I can think of nothing more disgusting than having to eat here, this location in particular. I haven't been back in over year, and I will never step foot into a Steak N Shake as long as I have an immune system that I care about. \n",
      "\n",
      "After having eaten here, I hit the restroom on my way out (along with my two friends....hey, we're girls, it's acceptable!). One stall was already taken, so two of us are stuck waiting while this occupant does her....shall we say, business? After a few seconds, we realize that she's not only there to relieve herself, but to also take drive-through orders. Yes, that's right....\"You want fries with that? *flush* Okay, that will be $5.50\". I have never, ever witnessed anything so insane as a drive-through restroom. To top it off, after finishing her \"bathroom break\", she walks straight out of the stall and into the restaurant. I guess she was in too much of a rush to complete the order she had just taken that she didn't have time to wash her hands. And I was in too much of a rush to choke back up what I had just eaten before it wreaked mayhem on my stomach. I love Steak N Shake. This one, however, leaves a lot to be desired. The food often comes out cold and the servers are apathetic at best. Most of the time, they're downright rude. I highly recommend avoiding this location if possible. There's one on Route 51 that's worth the 15 minutes it'll take you to get there. I never thought that I'd be giving Steak 'n Shake a 4 star review, but I really enjoyed my dinner here tonight. It just hit the spot!\n",
      "\n",
      "I was impressed by our waiter as soon as we walked through the door. He apologized for our very brief wait to be seated and for the fact that he was the only waiter working at that time. However, everything was delivered promptly, and he made what would've been just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience.\n",

      "For just $9 for me and my husband, I have to admit that we had forgotten how inexpensive Steak 'n Shake was. Based on the cost, the food, and our fantastic waiter, we'll be back soon. I like the occasional steak and shake stop.....    but this one has to be the slowest one ever.    The cashier was rude and I could hear her yelling are you fucking kidding me because the register was not working the way she wanted....     wow.... just wow... Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere, just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour. Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over, and it took 30 m8n to get our take out order. This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside, it's usually the drive-thru where things fall a part.  \n",

      "Just take a gun on Weekends, you'll be fine. This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order, even when there was only 1 car ahead of me. Then the lady proceeded to ask me if I would like anything on my burger, and (thinking the pictures on the menu are what they're supposed to look like and they would never false advertise) I asked \"doesn't it come with the fixings like in the picture?\" she then told me it only comes with cheese. So I then went on to tell her what I wanted on my burger. Pulled around and got my order pretty quick, but later when I open my burger its just meat and cheese. The meat is badly burned and cold. It was clear to me this burger was not fresh. I didn't even attempt to eat it, what a waste of a place. They definitely need better workers. Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons, tomatoes, carrots, cabbage, lettuce and chicken breast. (They forgot the cheese!) The staff wasn't very friendly or helpful and seemed like they didn't want to be there. There usually is a long wait at Steak 'n Shake, but if you catch them when they aren't busy, you will breeze through- drive-thru that is. I do like their food and you can eat healthy options, but the staff isn't helpful and the quality isn't always there. Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.\n",
      "\n",
      "I do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking, sitting and texting.  I'm fine with cooking my food being fourth on the \"to do\" list because there is no where else togo really....\n",

      "This was annoying but understandable. It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders, and I got 3 little tiny tenders, and a decent amount of fries. Also the restaurant is not really clean either.  This restaurant is not my number 1 choice. As far as I'm concerned, Filene's Basement is good for two things: cheap dresses and cheap accessories.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a young performer, I need good-looking dresses for frequent auditions -- and I need a couple, so I'm not wearing the same thing every time. The dresses on the second floor usually range from $30-60 and are good for over a year. It can be hard to find a full-length dress that's not reminiscent of a prom dress, but their selection of cocktail-length dresses is ample.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As far as accessories go, Filene's tends to have cheap versions of popular trends. If I feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad, Filene's is the place to go. Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still, I am always still wearing the clothes and shoes 3 months later. \n",
      "\n",
      "I kind of suspect this is the best shopping in Pittsburgh; it's much better than the usual department stores, better than Marshall's and TJ Maxx and better than the Saks downtown, even when it has a sale. Selection, bargains AND quality.\n",
      "\n",
      "I like this Filene's better than Gabriel Brothers, which are harder to get to. Gabriel Brothers are a real discount shopper's challenge and I'm afraid I didn't live in Pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills . . . Filene's was still up and running in June 2007 when I left town. Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales, but I always find something I like here.  This isn't your average Marshall's or TJ Max.  I think the green dress I'm wearing is from Filene's! This is probably my favorite store in Pittsburgh, for the selection and variety of discounted designer clothing. Other stores carry the same stuff but for much, much more, and it's hard to find all the stuff that the Basement carries in one spot. (Yes, I admit that the 'burgh has some cool stores.) I would do most of my clothes shopping here if I were here more often. Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question? $9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry, I thought I was in Pittsburgh, not New York City. Sing Sing, a dueling piano bar, is fun, but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if I could have more than one watered down drink before I warbled my way through \"Paradise City\" with the rest of the crowd. Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.  The drinks were on the pricey side, but I didn't head here to get smashed. Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return. Piano Man to the tune of Gangster's Paradise...what more do I have to say? Get there early if you want a seat, $7 cover and really fun crowd. We had sucha great time and I can't wait to go back. SingSing!!! What a blast! One of my favorite places to jam on Earth!! Cool bar, cool town, cool people... What else do you need!! The piano players are great, funny, semi-good lookin'... I mean dude, you gotta go!!! :) Love me some SingSing! Well, the experience did not start well. When we walked in the singing we heard was NOT good. Oy was it not good... Thankfully, it (mostly) improved from there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So there were 3 piano players rotating out on a half hour basis. So each was on for an hour and off for half. Of the 3, two were really good. Good singers, good piano players, and very funny. The third guy, well, not so much. Piano skills were fine. But his singing was not. When he sang in his range, he wasn't too bad actually, but too often he reached for notes that he couldn't get to or forced things that just weren't going to happen. Often his jokes fell completely flat. Luckily the other two usually did most the talking.\n",
      "\n",
      "They played a variety of songs as requested by the crowd and would do them in unconventional styles if requested (Closer by NIN as sung by a lounge singer was a highlight). We requested Britney Spears' Toxic cause we thought it would be funny and so they gave it a shot and as luck would have it, it turned out REALLY good. That takes some serious talent to pull off. If they didn't know it (like Toxic) they'd find it and play it. They played a wide variety of stuff.\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the experience is based on the crowd. We had a couple larger groups (there on a Thursday night, so smallish group in general) that they interacted with a lot, providing some running jokes and comedy. Of course, that also meant some annoying drunk people feeling like they could take over half the show.\n",
      "\n",
      "My friends were BIG fans of the super cheap beer specials. $1 drafts from Rock Bottom next door. The waitress wasn't great but it could have been that she was the only one there and the layout isn't that easy to navigate. The bar was generally uncrowded though so getting service there was fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "If in the Waterfront for a night out, definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you are up for some fun and willing to sit through a couple clunkers of songs/jokes. Having a fun loving group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rails a bit will help make it more fun. While we were in Pittsburgh for the Winter Classic on New Years Day, we figured we'd see what the area had to offer for NYE. My wife and I, along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up Sing Sing in Homestead. It's apparently located on what was the site of one of the largest steel mills in the area. When it closed they turned the entire site into a large outdoor shopping and entertainment development. The only remaining artifacts from what once was, were the nine or so original mill smoke stacks still standing at the primary entrance. Pretty cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sing Sing, which is a piano bar, is attached to the Rock Bottom Brewery and serves a selection of RBB's in-house brews and shares a similar menu. There are no TV's, no sports memorabilia (which is rare for this city), and no big booths for large groups. This place is all about being a cabaret with the focus on the musicians. Mind you this isn't a bad thing, just note that if you want a bar, go next door or across the street to Dave and Busters. I'd say Sing Sing holds about 150 people seated.\n",
      "\n",
      "This particular night they were hosting a (shocker) NYE's party. For $40 bucks a person you got a choice of two entrees (beef tenderloin tips or lemon chicken), veggies, mashed potatoes, one free drink coupon, a midnight champagne toast, and, what turned out to be over four hours of non-stop music. Again... Pretty Cool.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were three musicians holding down the fort playing more than just piano (drums, electric synth, bass guitar, and apparently I missed the sax). There was plenty of crowd involvement. As in most piano bars you request songs along with a tip. The larger the tip, the better chance of hearing your song you have. I put three requests on a sheet with a 10 and managed to get two played. Their rendition of Toto's Africa was fantastic and surprisingly, my curve ball got hit out of the park when one of the guys actually knew the tune and words to the Theme from TV's \"Growing Pains.\" I was sold from that point on.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will take this time to note that this is NOT a family friendly joint. I'm not sure if it was 21+ only but I certainly wouldn't bring anyone too young to drive. A good amount of sexual refrences and strong language awaits you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks were stiff and not horribly overpriced. I think rail mixed drinks were $7.00 and beers were 6 or so (RBB doesn't brew anything I particularly enjoy so I stuck with rum and cokes). All and all my bill wasn't scary and I'm not used to that on Dec 31st. Waitress staff was really nice and incredibly attentive. No complaints there. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only down side to everything was group seating as you're sitting at 2-top cab tables. It was easily fixed though as the group next to us was up for rearranging tables from side to side to front to back (allowing us to talk and share food/booze etc), also, being a tourist, we had no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in Homestead. Understandably NYE has its issues with cab availability but we had to wait 2.5 hours for a cab because, as we found out, Homestead is a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drives. \n",

      "\n",
      "All and all a good time and someplace I'd certainly return to if for any reason I'd be back in Pittsburgh... as long as I have a car. In my opinion, Sing Sing is really not worth it. It gets expensive because you drink, maybe start to sing a few lyrics, drink some more, think of a song you wanna hear, put $5 and title of said song on a piece of paper, you drink, they play it, everyone else is trying to get their songs played so you put $10 on your next sticky note...and so on and so forth. I wasn't really into it when I first got there but as the night went on and lager went in I started to warm up to the place. I feel that if I have to drink in order to have a good time, it's not worth it. But again, that's just me.\n",

      "This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. \n",

      "Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! \n",
      "\n",
      "The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs, throw back songs, fight songs, rap songs, pop songs. You name it, they play it. \n",
      "\n",
      "My favorite part is when they switch out to another two guys. They'll all four get on stage and play two piano's, a guitar and drums. They usually rock out with some fun familiar songs (um, Journey, of course!). \n",

      "The birthday song is seriously the best. They sing to you....and call you some names....with expletives. But in a totally nice way of course. You just have to go! Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square, and they died out. Then when the chain restaurant magnet \"waterfront\" opened in 2000 the parent company of The Rock Bottom Breweries decided to open Sing Sing in back of The Brewery.\n",

      "When it first opened it was pretty cool. The very first house band could put on a show that led to standing ovations. I know, I was there. From Stairway to Heaven to Free Bird, Stayin' Alive to She's My Cherry Pie, Elton John to the Boss, they were amazing at sounding like the bands they were covering. Equally incredible were the obscure songs that audience members would shout out, songs only you though you knew, and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song, sounding like the band who's song they sung.\n",
      "\n",
      "But today, Sing Sing seems like it's stuck in the early part of the 21st century. The whole dueling piano, shout out a song to stump the band, Sing us a song you're the piano man has run it's course. I don't hate Sing Sing, but I could never come here more than once a year. It's a been there, done that kind of place. If you want to be wowed by musical talent and want to laugh all night, go to Sing Sing :) If you send a dollar up with a song request, they will play it. If they don't know it, they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like, or they will look up the lyrics and sing it!! They aim to please :) I have definitely been pleased :) Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything, and if they don't know it, they will search for who requested the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy! :) Great humor too!! :) What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road, because I could see myself being a regular here.\n",

      "Honestly, these guys have got some talent, like real talent.  They can play the piano, sing, play guitar, and the drums.  Did I mention that they are all pretty hilarious, too.  I'd easily pay the $7 cover to get in here any day because it really is worth it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I am sure I will be back in no time at all.  Next time, I am bringing a big group of friends. Came here with a group of girls and didn't have a reservation. We paid the cover, walked in and it was absolutely packed. There was nowhere to even stand. One of our friends was having issues with an expired license and when we found out that not all of us got in, they let us get our $7 cover back without issue. \n",

      "I recently went with a big group who had reserved about 50 seats. People who were not in the group kept coming in to the reserved area but the staff was very helpful in dealing with the group. \n",

      "They brew their own beer so do not expect to see any known brands. There are only about 6 beers on top, so if you are more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices. They also have mixed drinks and wine. The mixed drinks around about $9 and they have a limited number of bottled wines (despite what it says on the menu). \n",
      "\n",
      "The entertainment was great and I would recommend it for a group outing. But definitely make sure that you have a reservation. This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However, each year the crowd seems to get smaller and smaller.  Crowd is an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all.  I was there last Saturday night (8/4/12) and there was about 20-30 people there.  Very slow and boring.  It appears the crowd is no longer allowed up on stage, taking a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place used to be.  This was likely my last time at Sing Sing.  Save your $7 and skip this place.  A real shame because this place was once a lot of fun. Had an absolute blast!! Great for any crowd, any occasion, any age!

      "If you're looking to grab a bite to eat or a beer, come on in!  Serving food and brews from Rock Bottom Brewery, Sing Sing keeps your tummy full while you listen to two (or more) amazingly talented pianists take your musical requests.  They'll play anything you'd like, for tips of course.  Wanting to hear Britney Spears?  Toto?  Duran Duran?  Yep, they play that... new or old.\n",
      "\n",
      "The crowd makes the show, so make sure you come ready for a good time.  If the crowd is dead, it's harder for the Guys to get a reaction.  If you're wanting to have some fun, it can be a GREAT time!  It's the perfect place for Birthday parties - especially if you want to embarrass a friend.  The guys will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty.  For being a good sport, you get the coveted Sing Sing bumper sticker.  Now who wouldn't want that?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dueling Pianos and brews... time to Shut Up & Sing Sing! First time here tonight and I must say I wasn't sure if I wanted to go. It seemed like it might be ok but nothing special but I decided to go with friends and man did I have a blast. The $7 door charge was great figuring u had music from 8 until probably 2 am ( we left shortly after 1). The food was not super but good prices reasonable. The beer left something to b desired as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their crafts. I asked for something similar to yeungling but what I got was nothing like it. The musicians were great they made this place awesome. We will b back and this may b our new Pittsburgh hangout Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table, you better freaking go! \n",
      "\n",
      "I had no complaints about the place itself! The guys were hilarious and watching my brother get made fun of multiple times was just the cherry on top! Anddd this has to be the only place I've ever enjoyed being around people who were sloppy drunk, because the comedians take no prisoners! \n",
      "\n",
      "I did enjoy when Matt and Joey were the ones up there because they are just amazing and make it so much better! They are great at what they do. Can't wait to go back! My friend is a piano teacher, so I took it as a good sign that Sing Sing would be quality stuff. It was her birthday, and I didn't really know anything about dueling piano bars. I was picturing glossy black grand pianos with glittering notes, pianists in black jackets and crystal glasses full of red wine. I am really, really glad I was wrong. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was gritty, bawdy and quintessentially Pittsburgh. First off, the pianos are scuffed to hell, considering the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while being mildly humiliated. The musicians hammer away at them, and they're covered with N@ and Sing Sing stickers. It's obvious they've been well-loved. The music is anything but the elevator music I was picturing; it's rock, hip-hop, oldies, pop, and just about any genre imaginable thanks to the request system (send up a piece of paper with some money) and the amazing repertoire of the musicians. For instance, \"Rubber Ducky\" and \"Gangsta's Paradise\" were both featured when I was there, and both performed impeccably. They also honored a request for a Taylor Swift song only to receive $30 and a request for \"anything else,\" which they promptly followed. The musicians also do funny versions of popular songs, and throw in things like \"yinz\" instead of \"you.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "I saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night. It must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this, considering the energy, confidence, wit, empathy, boldness, silliness, cleverness, and sheer talent a job like this requires. They rotate performers in and out so there's not even an intermission. I've read comments about the baseness of the humor, but I had no doubt the guys up on stage were intelligent dudes. They had great personalities: one was about 140 pounds, cheeky, and quick-witted. He acted out every sport in the winter olympics, and was pretty into this 90-something-year-old lady in the audience called Joan. The other had crazy hair and bright blue Chucks, beatboxed as well as he sang, and made it point to play a handful of songs for my friend's birthday. \"I think Ray Charles is the most soulful guy of all time,\" he said when she requested him.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were tons of people celebrating birthdays, and one big bachelorette party the Saturday night I was there. The performers bring the birthday boy/girl, bachelor/bachelorette, etc. on stage (for a $20 tip, which is pretty easy to scrounge up among friends) and humiliate the hell out of them, i.e. this is not the place to be if you can't laugh at yourself. My friend had a short dress on when she sat on the piano, and they sang a three-minute song about her vagina.\n",
      "\n",
      "Luckily, the show eclipsed the bad service and overpriced, weak drinks, because those did feature heavily throughout the night. The rest of the staff was friendly, however, and I stumbled on the door guy singing and dancing by himself, which made me smile.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sing Sing is definitely not an every weekend type of thing (much like Hofbräuhaus), but is a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion. Definitely belongs on every required Pittsburgh experiences list. Always a good time, although it's definitely not a place I would visit often. It's great for groups....which is quite obvious since there are always several folks there for bachelorette  parties and birthdays. \n",
      "\n",
      "Shut out to the piano players, who can not only play the piano, but also sing, play the drums and the sax. They are funny and know how to keep a crowd entertained. Also know some pretty obscure songs. \n",
      "\n",
      "My big criticism is the set up. If you don't have a reservation and/or come later in the evening, it's difficult to get seats. Believe me, I don't mind standing, but it does become a bit awkward when you have to keep scooting over to let waitresses and patrons past you. If you do find a seat, it is often littered with someone else's empty glasses. The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd, so I can't say they are all bad.  However the minimum for a song request is $5.  I spent $20 on a song for my girlfriend and they NEVER played it!!  They were playing songs for $5 and $10, but my $40 got me no where.  Even if they didn't know the song, which I doubt, they could have picked one they knew and improvised,  my tip, save your $$ on the requests.\n",
      "\n",
      "Otherwise it's fun for special events every once in awhile. I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations, which was good because it was packed that Saturday night. The performers were very talented, but the acoustics were strangely off.   The theme that ran through the whole show was, to quote some phrases they kept repeating, \"you bitch, you slut, you whore\" and  \"twinkle twinkle little slut, why don't you take it up the butt\" which one of the pianists wrote on the mirror at the back of the stage... You get the idea?  Perhaps if I had not been the designated driver, alcohol would have made these jokes funny the fifth, sixth, seventh time. Or maybe not. He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls. Pretty fun place to go every once in a while, but, believe me, by the end of the night you'll be ready to go. The show lasts around 5 hours, by the 3 hour mark you'll be sick of sitting there in the crowd with your $9 a pop drinks listening to the same dirty jokes over and over and over again. My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \"Rock Bottom\" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday, if their drinks weren't so damn expensive maybe more people would show up. And sometimes they used vulgar language which was just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still been hilarious. Also there was no table service, and the only bartender was a bitch. I'll probably be back, but only for a special occasion when I can afford it. I brought my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratched bumper.  The damage was minimal, but the work required removing my entire bumper for repainting.  The staff were very helpful in explaining my options and presenting me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck.  They completed the work in the quoted amount of time and did a great job.  A few weeks later, I noticed a spot that needed touched up and they handled it immediately and without question.  I would definitely recommend these guys if you need bodywork or paint work done. I was so pleased with the quality of customer service at this body shop, from the very first time I took my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when I got my car repaired (they still remembered me!). One thing I really like is that they always pick up the phone. You wouldn't believe how annoying it is when businesses don't do this during normal business hours. They're so personable and gave me an honest quote that I couldn't turn down because it was the lowest in town (I checked out 5 places). They just really made this process painless and smooth. I believe it's a family-run business, and boy does it show in their hospitality.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fran and Jason were the ones that I worked with -- extremely knowledgeable and patient, especially with a customer like me who wants to make sure all the paperwork is thorough and calculations are accurate. Joe DiIorio's (with an \"i\" not an \"l\") Auto Body also works closely with Enterprise Car Rental down the street, so they came and picked me up. Those guys down there have a great relationship with this body shop as well and were really accommodating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the quality of their work is amazing. I had a large dent on the driver side front bumper and had to replace my light (they ended up getting an OEM light instead of the aftermarket one because it didn't match) and get a brand new bumper. They blended the paint for me, washed, waxed, and vacuumed my car, AND their work has a lifetime guarantee. What can I say other than give my highest recommendation and hope other Yelpers can find this helpful, as this is how I found out about them. From my first phone call to Joe Diliorio's, I was impressed. Every staff member I spoke too was kind and eager to help. I was treated like an important client even though my car needed only moderate repairs from a low speed collision. I was able to bring my car in right away for an assessment of the damage. Joe Dilorio's took care of everything from that point on. They dealt directly with my insurance company, ordered the parts (even getting new parts instead of the used ones my insurance company wrote the estimate for, at no cost to me), and gave me a call when all the parts came in. I then brought my car back to them and they completed the repairs in a timely fashion. When I arrived to pick up my vehicle, I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had vacuumed, washed, and waxed my car! Most importantly, the repair work was absolutely top notch. They masterfully blended the paint to match older parts with newer repair parts. My car looks even better than before the wreck!\n",

      "-Adam Joe Dilorio's Auto Body Shop was so helpful when I needed to get windows replaced. The were able to give me a lower quote then competing auto body shops in the area. They were also incredibly friendly and a pleasure to do business with. I'm planning on taking my car here for all future auto needs. This is the best place we've ever taken our cars to. Their customer service is outstanding. It appears that they really like doing what they do because they are always willing to explain everything in detail. I also like that they don't over charge. I completely trust them to be honest and do the best job possible. This place is amazing! I needed my car repaired after an accident and the guys here were so helpful. They set me up with a rental car as soon as I dropped my car off, repaired my car in a timely manner, detailed it for free, and their customer service was unbelievable!!! I can't recommend this place more! I'm grateful to my insurance company for recommending Di Iorio's Auto Body Shop. After an accident, I needed some body work done as soon as possible. The other recommended shops wouldn't even make an appointment to see me for days. These guys fit me in that afternoon, and coordinated the rental too. Everyone I worked with was courteous and pleasant, and the work was done more quickly than expected. Moreover, they found ways to help save on the expense. The car came out looking better than before the accident -- a few days later, I noticed they had buffed out some scratches that weren't even part of the repair area. I will definitely be back next time I need auto repairs. I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However, this time was very different. I called to find out how much they might charge to install some brakes and rotors that I had, i was reffered to Mark, the mechanic. I made the appointment with him for Tuesday Sept 30th, he quoted me between $179 - $200 for the work (though the first person I spoke to quoted $150-$179) and told me to bring it at 8am and it would be finished the same day.when I brought it on Tuesday, Septempber 30th at 8 am, Mark forgets that i even made the appointment with him (or didnt bother to make a note of it) saying, \"oh, I thought you were supposed to bring this by yesterday\". He says I should expect this to probably be done before 3pm. \n",
      "\n",
      "I soon recieve a call from Mark at 10:25am, where he tells me the charge will actually be $240 (for four hours of labor + $13 worth of materials, before even getting started to see how long the job would actually take) and that the car would be ready by 3pm, if not possibly before that. Also for good measure he decides to randomly throw in, \"oh, and we don't take checks\". \n",
      "\n",
      "The next phone call is at 3:50pm to ask if i actually need to have the car back today, I tell Mark, \"yes, of course\". (I was expecting to be ready by 3, if not before like he said) When I express that I definitely need it today, he says that he just has to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415. This leaves me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430. Honestly if what he had to finish on my car could easily be completed between 3:50 and 4:15, i dont think he would bother asking if i still needed to have it that day. As a result I feel that he may have rushed something while putting my car back together, because now something feels slightly off with the feeling of how the cars is aligned or the way the car drifts at times. SO lucky to be referred to Joe DiIorio's after moving to Pittsburgh. It's really invaluable to have \"car guys\" that you trust. I could detail several experiences here (in comparison to other chain shops), but suffice it to say that they've always been honest, helpful, and fair. Typical, but new.  \n",

      "Can't really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes it's a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate. This local Lowe's serves its purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two. I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store. I am not sure how it compares to other Lowe's stores, but when shopping at the Home Depot in North Fayette last fall, their flower selection was dismal compared to this Lowe's. Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it, but it's true. Excellent wings and sandwiches, generally good food otherwise, and fair prices-- nice casual place. The service can be a little slow due to how popular the place gets at peak times. The food here can actually be a little hit and miss, but I love the grilled cheese club with fries. I get it way too much. People make fun of me.\n",

      "They have a ten dollar minimum for credit cards, fyi. 3.5 rounding down. Its been a while since JB and I ate here and I would consider going back but we just haven't gotten around to it.

      "Great Bar in the up and coming Homestead area.....Highly recommend We're always looking for non-chain restaurants by the Waterfront (they do exist...), and this has become a favorite. I've had the Hot Roast Beef & Fries and the Corned Beef on Rye, and both were delicious. Every beer I've had here has been ice cold, and the service has been strong too. It's a great place to watch a Pirates game too. Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months. Awesome wings and pubgrub! Great beer selection and fun bartenders. This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout. There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place, but the food was average at best.  We were there on a Pens Playoff night and there were 2 people working all the tables in both rooms.  Our food came to us cold and unimpressive at that.  Our orders were somewhat mixed up.  The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.  If you are looking for good food, Homestead better choices at Blue Dust or Tin Front. Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however, today the service was terrible. We waited two hours for a pizza sub, French onion soup, fries, and buffalo chicken tenders. About an hour and a half in we finally got the small pizza sub and the wrongly made buffalo chicken tenders (ie, no hot sauce). We were told by the waitress that she realized it was wrong, but decided to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it. She sent it back. By a half hour later, we still had not received the buffalo chicken tenders, nor the French onion soup (which should have been mostly made already), and no fries.  We were told the chef was new, but no effort was made really to make the situation better. No quick and easy app or beers on the house. To boot, the beer was pretty expensive. I will probably give the place another chance based on their beer selection, but it won't be for a while. The food has always been average at best, and the pizza sub was no different. We ended up leaving after two hours without receiving 75% of our order. I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time, but the food was good. It wasn't too busy so our service was very attentive and it didn't take long to get our food at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "The place is separated between a bar area and a more family style dining area. We sat in the dining area because the bar area was pretty full. The dining room area definitely fills up with an older, have lived in Pittsburgh all their lives crowd, while the younger crowd is in the bar area. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'll definitely be back since I live in the area. Duke...the owner...is the man.  He's a true Pittsburgher and he loves everyone from Pittsburgh.  He looks like he'll beat you up but he's a softy with a big heart.  Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers. I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is true, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.\n",

      "It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit. \n",
      "Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.\n",

      "I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it. Food is good here. Great beer selection on tap. Sometimes the beer is on the pricey side. What I want from a neighborhood bar is a neighborhood special. Pinkerton is one of the best sandwiches. Good place to watch football, hockey, baseball. One of my favorite local eateries. The mild & wild sauce is my absolute favorite, I wish I could purchase it. I am not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich is great & reminds me of a fatheads sandwich. Food portion is great. The only complaint I would have if any is the craft beer is a little on the pricey side, as usual in most local bars. Friendly service, will continue to frequent with my family.

      "The Dave & Busters idea was conceived in Little Rock, Arkansas back in the 1970s. Two different businesses (one a popular watering hole & one a game & entertainment business) were right next door to each other. The two young owners were friends and quickly realized that combining their businesses made perfect sense. So they opened the first combined D & B in  . . . . no, not Little Rock, but Dallas! To this day there are no D & B's in Little Rock. Not sure what is up with that! But lots of other cities have been the beneficiaries of these two friends combining their businesses.\n",

When I lived there, a group of friends and co-workers (and me, of course!)used to go there for Happy Hour & Power Hour . . . . at least once a week. We had a blast!  A great place to kick-back and let the worries of the work day melt away.\n",

      "\n",
      "You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).\n",

Sadly, they topped the dip off with horrible orange shredded cheese that appeared to have been popped in the microwave for a few seconds.  Blahhhh.  Trying to get something healthy, I ordered the apple pecan salad.  I swear the dressing came right out of the grocery store bottle.  I could barely eat the salad.  Too sweet.\n",

It can get expensive and the 'prizes' are cheap but it make for great \"sister days\" \n",

      "As for the food, we've eaten there once and never again. It's just blah... frozen and fried. The veggie burger was put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it. A frozen Boca patty thrown on a bun. Thanks! I could have ran to Costco for that. Drinks are rather expensive but that's to be expected. \n",
      "\n",
      "So go for the games, fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drinks and a bite to eat (skip the bountiful chains that span the Waterfront and try Blue Dust on Amity Street). The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado, bacon, and turkey breast. What I got was TOTALLY different from the picture! First of all the sandwich was on sliced bread (lame)! There was no avocado, 1 slice of bacon, no lettuce, and to TOP it off instead of turkey breast they used freaking LUNCH MEAT! lol No, not the kind that you get from the deli, the other sweaty nasty looking stuff! Gross! \n",

I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play, we ended up winning a little over 700 tickets! They also have Fruit Ninja as a game. It was fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you don't win as many tickets as you would hope. I wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counters like the other D&B's I've been to, where you feed a counting machine your tickets. At this place, they just weigh your tickets and give you the final count. We didn't try the food here and instead went to P.F. Chang's to eat before coming here, but the Eat & Play deal looked fun. Too bad it was only restricted to certain times of the day. Overall I had a blast here and definitely would come back. Hopefully next time when there is a deal or promotion. A table for 16 please...   That is what I had to ask for and knew that D&B could accomodate.\n",

It is a great place to go when you are wanting to have a great time with a great group of friends.  If you find you and your friends bored on a Friday or Saturday night, come to D&B and win some prizes!!  It is pricey though, so bring some major moolah Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games, go Wednesday when all the games are half off. Food is pretty good and a nice bar. The downside is that the booze is pretty pricey. When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look, there are signs that say kids must be accompanied by an adult, but apparently no one was honoring that at 6PM on a Saturday. I couldn't even walk through the place without someone shoving me. AHHH!\n",
      "I get that Dave and Buster's is an arcade and that you're going there to play some games, maybe eat, and kill some time. When I last went there a few years ago, we there for my bachelor party, and while I'm sure we got into some shenanigans, I don't remember children running wild there. We were having adult beverages, playing games, and having a good time. This time, it was ridiculous. It isn't Chuck E. Cheese, yet that's how parents seem to be treating the place.\n",
      "On top of that, the customer service sucked. The place is gigantic, with tables and serving areas everywhere, yet on a Saturday at 6PM, the hostess told us (after interrupting us three times to chat with the other hostess) told us it would be a three hour wait, despite the fact that there were empty tables all over the dining room. I suspect this is a ploy to get you to play games and spend money until you're table is ready, but the food at Dave and Buster's is not worth a three hour wait on any day.\n",
      "The hostess told us we could be served right away if we went to the midway and found an empty table, so we attempted that. Most of those tables were empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table filled with coats who informed us that they needed the table because their kids would be back soon after playing games. Next, i engaged in the most rudest thing I've ever done- I began stalking tables where people were finishing up. I would walk up to people paying their check, ask if I could have their table when they were done, and they would inform me that there were already two or three people who asked them and I should get in line.\n",
      "Finally, we found a table and proceeded to spend two hours eating dinner. It wasn't because we ordered a lot of food- it was that the waiter took forever to bring our food out. He seemed to have no problem getting us fresh drinks, until we drank as much as we could and then asked for water. After that, he seemed to come around a lot less. \n",
      "I had the build your own chicken tacos, which comes on a giant plate with all kinds of fixings. The fixings were fresh, but the chicken was cold and dry, and the tortillas were dried out as well. For $14, it wasn't worth it. \n",
      "After dinner we proceeded to play games, which entails shoving people to get through areas and waiting in line to play anything. \n",
      "All in all, I didn't like my experience at Dave and Busters. I remembered it being a fun place to go and unwind as an adult. but between all the kids and the crappy service, can't recommend this place. If anyone asks me to go back, I may elect to stay home and poke my eyes with a fork. Not a cheap night out you will end up spending money here.  But it is busy fun entertaining and a good time out.  I ate dinner here and the food was great i also played pool and the arcade games. My friend and I both had Friday off so we decided we wanted to do something more interesting than just hit up a bar on Thursday night. We settled on Dave and Busters. I went on Facebook and printed off a coupon for buy $20 get $20 in play free (we split the card, it took us about 1.5-2 hours to get through)\n",
      "\n",
      "The games weren't *quite* as fun as I remembered, but it was still a good time. The place was far from crowded, and when a machine was out of tickets, it took us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us. When we did, the team at D&B could not have been more accommodating. To apologize for our wait they swiped us in for several games as well as gave us a handful of tokens for the game we were playing. \n",
      "\n",
      "I think a lot of companies (I'm looking at you, American Airlines) could learn a lot from D&B. It cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for games, but it made our experience so much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks are half-price after 8 or 9, my Tropical Mojito was awesome! My friend and I are definitely planning on going back on a Wednesday for half-price games AND half-price drinks. Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. \n",

      "Dining: 2 stars\n",

      "I had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time, and arrived early. They immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and I waited; the hostess, after taking my name, never spoke to us again. She did not tell us when we could sit, how long it would be, or any other information. And then they made us wait for 75% of our party to show up before they would seat us. Mind you, there was no one else waiting, and the table was ready, and we were ready to order. But they didn't tell us this; I didn't even know why we were being forced to wait until I heard a supervisor whispering to the waitress about making us wait. I still have no idea why we were forced to wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "When my full party was finally seated, we were helped by two waiters who were perfectly polite and nice. BUT, our service was rather haphazard. People would order drinks and food, and get things at wildly different times. One person was done eating appetizers and drinks when another was just getting their first drink. I know there was chaos to a big party, but it got a little out of hand.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food is pretty standard American chain food, comparable to Appleby's and Chili's - not offensive, but nothing to knock your socks off. It has a decent selection, and a few good desserts and appetizers, and everything was competently prepared. Overall, it is a fine enough meal for a large group before going to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable prices, but some of the service standards are poor. In the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to D&B's for games.\n",

      "Drinks are predictably expensive, but there is a wide variety. The problem is that about half of them don't even kind of resemble what is on the menu, and most don't have enough alcohol to even taste. Worse yet, while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade, the staff is either completely non-interactive or just rude. You have to track them down, and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruined their life.\n",

      "There are a lot of great games here to play, and many that are fun with groups or pairs. It is a great place for a large party, because you can mingle with all your friends playing many different very fun games. If you are a couple, there are also many great selections that everyone enjoys. The staff on the floor is helpful and fast to fix games that have problems, and are typically polite. The ticket prizes are cheap as expected, but kind of fun, and the people in the ticket shop were always nice and quick to help.\n",

      "First let me say that this isn't my first trip to a Dave & Buster's.  Second, I actually experience all of it while here.  We will start with the food/service.  Staff, you were wonderful.  You were polite, you greeted us as soon as we walked in the door, gave us no qualms while ordering and were swift with your delivery.  Food, you were not wonderful.  I ordered the BBQ chicken breasts.  This came with a side of broccoli and their type of mashed potatoes.  The chicken was a bit dry and in some places you can tell it was left on the grill a little too long.  There were actually some bites that all I could taste was charred meat.  There wasn't enough BBQ sauce on the the chicken either.  The broccoli appeared to have been cooked prior and then thrown back into a pan to be seared.  Some of my broccoli actually had some burnt crisp areas on it.  Also I noticed that there were still some leaves left on the broccoli.  The mashed potatoes I wanted to like (which I hoped would be the best part of the dish, I'm a bit of a potato freak), but alas, I was let down. *sad face* They were cold and such a tiny portion.  With a tiny amount of shredded cheese and bacon but into that divot they made with the scoop to get it out of it's container.  Oh food, how if I didn't need you to survive, I wouldn't complain about you.\n",

      "The building right now is in disarray.  They are in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtains covering up certain sections of their dining area.  No bar out in the dining area right now and the pool tables were absent as well.  If you wanted a drink you had to go back into the game room.\n",
      "\n",
      "Speaking of the game room, by far the best part.  With the meal I ordered I got the $20 play card (the best part of the meal, super charge it for $3 more and it's even better).  The game room  you can tell is in need of an update.  The carpet is worn and other signs of wear are noticeable as well.  One good thing is the games.  They change them up so often that there is always something new once you return.  Who knew that playing Connect 4 could be so fun, or for that matter Skee Ball rises to the top of my list to play.\n",

      "- Fun time overall with the wife. Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager. Not being from the area, I traveled an hour to come here from Uniontown, PA. I was excited! I haven't been to this Dave and Buster's since I was younger and was ready to go back and play me some games! I went with my cousins, mind you, we hadn't ate all day and were very hungry. So, we decided to do the Eat & Play Combo, naturally. Here's where it gets bad. First of all, we get a very snobby hostess that shows us to our table. Then, we wait...and wait...and finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress. Her name was Ashley. We had plenty of time to decide what we wanted, so we quickly put our order in. Next, we were sitting and talking, waiting, we had empty glasses and our waitress had never even come around to see if we needed refills except for one time. She said she'd come back right away with our refills...yea, right. 20 mins later we get our refills. Mind you, our food still hasn't came yet. I see other people getting their food that had come in after us. I was frustrated. After waiting 45 mins for our food, I asked to speak with a manager. One of the servers who I asked replied rudely with \"Well, he's really busy right now. I doubt he'll be able to come out and talk to you\". Finally, 15 mins later...that's one hour, folks. We get our food. What do you think the next problem was? Yep, the food was cold. I was completely fed up at this point, and told my waitress how disappointed I was, especially after driving one hour just to have this terrible service. The manager never came to speak with me, and we didn't even receive our meals for free. The only compensation we got were $10 game cards. Woopty-doo. The only thing good about this place is the games, but the prizes you get for your tickets are all junk and worthless. So, in conclusion...I DO NOT RECOMMEND THE WATERFRONT DAVE AND BUSTERS OF HOMESTEAD, PA. It was horrible, and I will not be returning for a very long time! This place just plain sucks\n",

      "Hope they fire her.. First time at Dave & Buster's and although I didn't go for the games, I was slightly disappointed. I went with a group of girls for dinner and drinks.

Just don't expect to be seated in the restaurant portion, and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area. Was impressed by the new menu and new decor.   Our waitress was nice, knowledgeable and attentive.  However, the rest of the staff was less than stellar.  There was a power outage (less than one minute) while we were paying games (sunny and calm outside so not sure what happened). My family and I were playing a trivia game---we lost about ten dollars of credits and all our bonus tickets when the power resumed.   The games were down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff was not friendly when we inquired about what happened or when the games would be working again.  After the outage, two people in our groups could not get their power cards to work. When we asked staff for assistance they just brushed us off and said we must have been out of credits.  Kinda a bummer we lost so much money on (malfunction) game play tonight. Visiting from Toronto, I was really impressed! The amount of tickets to be won was incredible. We usually got 200 tickets per play on average. Compared to Playdium here, that's awesome considering I'd win at most 10 tickets with the smallest prize costing 100 tickets. The food is great, the place is clean and the games don't feel greasy or nasty from all the food. A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game ,ball racing car game and connect 4 also there are several games that can be played in groups of 4 Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead, PA last night. Waitress mixed up our credit cards and gave my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs. Charged them already too - both incorrectly My brother had to walk around and find out who it was. Waitress never apologized. GM was extremely rude and refused to give my brother his original receipt back saying they had thrown it out. DID NOTHING TO REMEDY the situation and ignored us the rest of our visit - not even a refill. After spending over $300 plus games, we will never go back. Whatever happened to the customer is always right? HORRIBLE service I love it!  Love it! My boyfriend and I are in our 20s, and have visited this D&B multiple times. After our visit yesterday, however, I don't think we'll be back. When we arrived we were greeted by a long line of people waiting to buy game cards. At first there were 2 extremely slow workers trying to do this, then one left while the line was still out the door! The girl that was left was more than incompetent, and was taking extremely long to fill these game cards. We stood in line for over 20 minutes before being told that there was another attendant in the actual game room. Needless to say, the line in the game room was just as long, and they still only had one girl in the booth. It was a Saturday! After we finally got our cards we had to wait yet again to get a beer. 2 bartenders on staff while the bar was completely full. It took us almost an hour before we actually could start gaming. The floors were filthy with trash, and the bathrooms: repulsive! I had to use the restrooms twice during our visit, and not only did both bathrooms I used have no toilet paper in them, but there was TP all over the floors, and the sinks were less than cleanly. My boyfriend mentioned that the guys restroom was no better, as it smelled like pee and the paper towel dispenser didn't work. All I have to say is get your crap together. We could see a difference in the type of crowed that was there on Saturday compared to what it used to be, and I'm I have no doubt it's due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness. For how expensive they are they need to staff better on weekends. It's a shame how quickly this place has gone down hill and we will NOT be returning anytime soon! Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around, the Peanut and I were really disappointed.  Won't be back. ehh, 3.5 -- I can't rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visits. Speaking of that, I've been here a few times, but never wrote a review for D&B. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the games. However, there have been multiple instances where I swiped my game card & it took my credits, but no game began. There have also been times that I won and no tickets were released. I guess nothing is perfect but it does happen atleast once a visit (each scenerio)  It's hard to find a worker walking around and for half-price games, you kind of just take your loss with the 1.3 credits for skee ball (hmph!)\n",
      "\n",
      "The food- it really isnt anything too fancy. I've had okay food, but super long wait times for a simple chicken fingers & fries for example. It's your basic sandwiches, salads, appetizers & a few pastas. I believe all sandwiches & burgers are around $10 & served with fries.  You can get the Eat & Play deal which includes food from a specific menu + a game card. Besides the game card deal, if you wanted to make D&B a date night you might be better off heading to another place to eat in Waterfront for amazing food.. but to each their own.  Try it once I suppose. The brownie sundae that i devoured last night was satisfying (2 brownies, 2 scoops of ice cream.. one with chocolate syrup; the other with raspberry sauce & fresh strawberries. Oh & whip cream)\n",
      "\n",
      "Drinks- pretty weak. We ordered 2 liquid maryjanes (2 each that is) which are filled with multiple shots of alchy & didn't really catch a buzz. Oh welllll. They do have a happy hour from 5-7pm. I'd go during that time for the best deal. I believe cocktails are half off & $3 off  bottles of wine. I've never seen anyone walking around with a wine glass though lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prizes- as others have noted, the prizes are a little cheap for the amount of tickets they \"cost\" However, it's cool to leave with a D&B coffee mug, cup or shot glass. Last night for 2500 tickets we decided on magnetic-style dart board (1,300?) a coffee mug, a D&B glass (our plastic one bit the dust) & a D&B coffee travel mug.. I might be missing a few odds & ends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall it's a fun time but can be pricey. It's best to head here Wednesday for half price games or get the Eat & Play deal while dining. \n",
      "\n",
      "I can't lie though, I find myself smiling ear to ear a few times within those 3 hours (woah, seemed longer than amount of time :D ) Speaking of which, in that time-frame we played 250 credits (cost= $40) but it was half-price games. Dave & Busters is a great experience  if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend.\n",
      "\n",
      "The main squeeze and I always 1) use a survey receipt for buy $10 get $10 in free gameplay or 2) Attend on a Wednesday during the day (flexible work schedules). We'd never dream of eating there because we like healthy yuppie food. And we only drink cheap drafts OR drink cocktails during happy hour.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your visit is largely determined by time of day, expectations and whether or not you eat their food. If you come on a Friday night, the lines will be long. You'll pay $150 for the two of you to eat, drink and play for 3 hours and you'll be left with a very sour taste in your mouth.\n",
      "\n",
      "The staff is really excellent; any issue with a game not paying out tickets results in immediate help and extra tickets or a swipe for a different game from an employee. \n",
      "\n",
      "Note the \"drinks are weak\" reviews. Also notice it was people buying shots and ordering multiple drinks per person. That's typical white trash behavior. Bartenders here are savvy; they mirror the behavior of the guests. All of our drinks have been consistently strong and well put together because we're courteous and tip well. I have witnessed bartenders bypass tattooed, loud guests and address me and take my order first. This is rational, logical behavior. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also note the \"prize center games suck\" comments. You're supposed to stack tickets over multiple visits and use them on a big prize. Like life, delaying gratification nets you bigger returns. Every other visit I've seen someone walk out with a video game system (Wii, Xbox360 and even a few Xbox One's). \n",
      "\n",
      "The thing about Dave & Busters is the crowd changes depending on day of week and time of day. Sunday afternoon it's all families and Friday and Saturday night it's all drunk 20 somethings. The atmosphere changes and that's why the reviews are all over the place.\n",
      "\n",
      "This review is based on 8ish months of 1-3/monthly visits. Most visits are 5 stars, some are 4 stars.\n",
      "\n",
      "Using survey receipts for Buy Ten Get Ten, avoiding Wednesday, Friday or Saturday evenings (and Sunday afternoon, families) and avoiding the food entirely and drinking cheaply, you'll have a great experience for $25-40/person.\n",
      "\n",
      "I really enjoy the staff too, they split the difference between fun and professional. Special shout out to Riley, gave us info on possibly hosting a party there. To keep it short and sweet: Save yourself $100. Buy a good board game, your alcohol of choice, order a pizza, and invite your friends over. \n",
      "\n",
      "What an incredible disappointment. After seeing the enticing commercials so many times, we decided to give this place a try on a double date. I understand the prices of the play cards and won't dispute them; however, the food was incredibly over-priced, came out COLD (as in, sat on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes) and I literally had to ask the bartender if there was any vodka in my drink. It was pure juice. $38 for three shots that had little-no alcohol in them. (Not to mention, my glass was dirty, and I saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she was too lazy to use the sanitary scoop. I know the Food and Beverage Commission would be as disappointed as I was.) The service was terrible. Don't ask for anything from your waiter, as they are a little too busy on their cell phones or conversing amongst themselves. \n",
      "\n",
      "Was it fun to be in an adult-themed arcade? Yes. If you're looking for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play games, I suppose I would advise you give it a shot. I would never recommend their food, customer service, or drinks. Save yourself the money and stay home, or go for a traditional bowling, figure skating, roller-blading, rock climbing, basically any other physically-entertaining themed date instead. I still love this place!  I spent my 36th birthday at D&B's and it was a wise decision!  i had so much fun, and so did my guest!  I got a very attentive serving staff, and met up with many helpful servers!  I believe that service has improved, so I bumped this restuarant up to 4 stars!  No five stars yet, because I've still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it!  It's still worth the visit, and is a lot of fun for a reasonable price! There is good food, but a great spot to enjoy a few drinks & watch sports on the big screens. It's great for adult fun after 10pm. Great for a first date if you like to have a good fun & feel relaxed My wife and I went here around 10pm on a Saturday night. The food was not spectacular, about the same quality that you'd get at an Applebee's or some place similar -- good but not great.  My steak was tough, but my wife enjoyed hers. Staff was relatively unorganized (we ate at a table next to the bar), and had to wait awhile for a server. Food was prompt. After having a few 'less than memorable' trips to D&B in years past, my wife and I  decided to go back for a Pittsburgh Happy Hour Anniversary party this past Thursday.  Pgh Happy Hour is a facebook group of friends that like to check out new 'watering holes' every thursday and it's run by a guy that seems to party 24/7 while still holding down a very lucrative full time job.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Anyway- Pgh HH was celebrating an anniversary and chose D&B for the location.  The D&B staff set up the back 'pool room' with complimentary,  enormous spread of appetizers with dips and kept refilling them when they got low.  Our server, Carla, was very attentive and friendly- making sure we were aware of the specials and checking back often when our glasses got to the half way point.  The other server back there was working equally as hard but I never got the chance to get her name.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I had been here one other time for an organized happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but I never got the chance to give them any credit.  I think D&B is an awesome place when you need some space for your next event. Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which, side note, is a great idea!\n",
      "\n",
      "It was around midnight and the bar wasn't really populated. There were three bartenders and only one was actually making rounds to see if anyone needed anything. The two other bartenders were chatting on the far side of the bar that no one was sitting at. Kind of counter productive if you ask me. \n",
      "\n",
      "I stood there for about 5 minutes, which for a busy bar is fine but when I am the only one with my card out then, it just seems a little ridiculous. I made eye contact with the one girl twice and gave her a smile and she literally turned away. I finally had to walk to them to get their attention.  I was standing right in front of them smiling and they didn't ask if i need anything. I finally said, \"Are you working?\" and they gave each other a weird look. I felt like i was the crazy one. I asked for a beer/got the beer.\n",
      "\n",
      "In between that time, the other bartender brought food over and set it down. She took a fry from the plate (right in front of me) and then served it to someone on the other side of the bar. What the hell! I felt like i was in some grimy bar in out in the sticks - not an established D&B. \n",
      "\n",
      "I was just really turned off from that experience. \n",
      "\n",
      "The good is that D&B provides a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up. I remember going here with my grandparents when I was a kid and it was the best treat ever! We would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours playing games. This place holds some really good memories for me. \n",
      "\n",
      "It's a shame that my experience last night has spoiled the high standards I held for it. Its fun, but much smaller than some of the others I've visited.  Its clean, staff is friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie. They do have good  food. Gets a 3 stars because I get bored easily at this location. I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront, but it has gone down hill over the years. The games are not as fun and do not give you as many tickets and the prizes have gotten cheaper in quality. It takes a whole heck of a lot of tickets for you to even get a pencil! The atmosphere is okay but it used to be so much better with the funnest games and diverse groups of people! Now, it is run down and many of the games are app related games (Fruit Ninja) and 3D Experience rides. With such \"games\", you can't even earn tickets and they take a lot of tokens! Last time I went, back in the winter, many of the games were broken, which made for a negative player experience. I would go to D&B to play some games again in the future, but it is no longer one of my favorite places to go due to the decline of fun games where you can earn tickets. I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage, no how is your food, no ketchup for my burger or fries was offered.  Lots of people running around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people!  I will not be back again to eat. I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games, drinking, and eating all at the same place? The one thing I can think of is the price. On the surface, this is a pretty expensive place; however, they give a bunch of good deals depending on the time you go, whether or not you \"donate\" money to the Make-a-Wish Foundation, and if you're lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prizes! But honestly, know what the deals are before you go to make sure to get the best price available. \n",
      "In regards to the games, there's a plethora for your enjoyment. Although it is nice to play games that spit out tickets, the last couple of times I've gone I've gotten 2 hours of arcade games for a very cheap price (Mario Kart, anyone?!). Either way, it's a really fun place that you'll most certainly have a good time at. First off, let me say that I find the people who usually work at Dave and busters usually don't care or seem to be angry and hate their job. A friend and I went here and found that a couple of the machines ran out tickets and someone was always there and happy to help. The staff went out of their way to make sure we had a good time. The manager Tony was very sweet and made sure everything was ok. Every staff member we talked to was extremely nice. This is by far the best Dave and busters I've had been to! My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though, everything was below average. They have a huge selection of games for the kids to play, but you pay dearly to play games here. The food is  overpriced and the drinks are drastically overpriced. Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Our first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \n",
      "\n",
      "The nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\n",
      "\n",
      "As far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \"Lumpy Dog\" to a dark \"Brew masters Choice.\"  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\n",
      "\n",
      "I give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place. Horrible beer, horrible service, horrible menu SUMMARY:\n",
      "If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go, I might come back for beer and appetizers.\n",
      "\n",
      "GOOD:\n",
      "- Decent beer...\n",
      "- Original pretzel appetizer.  You take chunks of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip.\n",
      "- Huge portions.  Most of us had leftovers.  The RB Appetizer Sampler was multi-story and way more food that we could handle.  The half order of ribs looked like a full rack.\n",

      "- Amusing name.\n",
      "\n",
      "BAD:\n",
      "- Lots of food choices... burgers... steak... chicken... salads.  Lots of drink choices... beers... wines... mixed drinks.  I guess this could be seen as good, but it takes a while for everyone to pick something and since no one's awesome at everything, you could tell right away that nothing distinguishes this place.\n",
      "- None of the food was super awesome.  Nothing was awful, but nothing stood out in any way.  I've had better beer, appetizers, and a better main course at plenty of breweries.\n",
      "- Kind of dead on a Monday night with 3/4 of the place empty.\n",

      "Entree :      Fire Steak, Pub Tips or Chicken Fried Chicken.\n",
      "Desert :      Carrot Cake (to die for)\n",
      "Bar food:     Pizza or ball park pretzels.  Both of which are sprayed with brown ale.  \n",
      "Half the menu is really good, the other half is great.  \n",
      "The beer is good.  Ask for the sampler!  They usually have a velvet and something on cask.  Ask for one of those if you are looking for something different.  They will also have a scotch ale, an IPA, whiskey stout or other specialty depending on the mood of the brewer (which, if its still Matt, the mood is GRUMPY).   If Andy is still working there, he is sure to please and Molly is great in the cocktail area.\n",
      "Head over to Sing Sing after dinner and its a wrap.\n",
      "I used to work there several years ago and I make it a point to hit every RB I possibly can.\n",
      "Don't go to the one in Charlotte though, its not really a Rock Bottom. I thought this place was pretty decent. My friend and I were both still reeling from thanksgiving dinner so we ordered salads... and they were HUGE. and tasty. I liked my salad though it was slathered in way too much dressing. My friend's was even more slathered so she didn't dig it too much. We'd also ordered chips with guacamole, the guac was pretty good. my friend enjoyed her beer. I enjoyed my coke (I know, I'm lame).\n",
      "\n",
      "so yeah... wasn't bad, wasnt the best, but it was okay. Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \"kind of like Coors Light\".  If I wanted Coors, I'll pay half as much and have one.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The food is actually a saving grace, as it was pretty good.  Head next door to Sing Sing for drinks, though. Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.\n",

      "I like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \"OK\" as far as beer goes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Large portions. Friendly staff. My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around. everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and i've never been dissappointed.  i sit in the bar, grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos.  the bar has a pool table and plenty of flatscreens.  rock bottom is a chain but it's one of the better chains in the area.  i'll pass on chili's or friday's and come to rock bottom instead.  oh and typically i walk over to target - work off some of those nachos. Nobody has reviewed this in a while, but I am surprised at the lack of lovin'!  My husband and I ate here a few nights ago and we liked it a lot.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started with drinks--he got the house-brewed Portland Wheat and said it was quite a good beer, and I got a mixed drink (Red Rock) that was also tasty.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He got a burger covered in mozzarella cheese and I got a mahi sandwich.  Both great--the fries and side salads are good here too, and there is no skimping on portions of anything.  There were tons of things on the menu that I'm looking forward to trying.\n",
      "\n",
      "We are usually not dessert people at all but ended the meal sharing a triple chocolate stout cheesecake--who can resist a beer cheesecake, come on!\n",
      "\n",
      "Our food and service was great.  They had the Penguins game on all the TVs in the bar and were setting up live music for after the game.  Seriously, what's not to like!?  I'm thinking this place has changed for the better since the last review a year ago... :) This is literally the first place I went when I first came to Pittsburgh - and I loved it. Hearty, full-sized meals, lots to choose from, and not too crowded or noisy. Although, for the sake of full disclosure, I didn't sit at the bar and I don't drink alcohol so I can't comment on that. I go back to Pittsburgh often and Rock Bottom ends up being a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night. Really, I have no complaints about this place so I'm surprised by the few low ratings here. Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.\n",
      "\n",
      "The burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry, but hey the burgers would choke a horse - and almost did.  :o) Lately, the Rock Bottom is hit or miss. The beers are always good and the Uppity Jagoff IPA is one of the best India Pale Ales I've ever tasted. The low point lately has been the food. I will never forgive the idiot in management who took the chicken quesadilla off the menu. That said, I ordered the lobster roll and when it arrived, the bread was as hard as a brick and cold. The filling was okay, but the lobster flavor was masked by over spicing. I suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the Rock Bottom. Pretty good! Excellent beer sampler - bargain!  Veggie burger awesome. Onion rings awesome. Fried Mac n cheese was delicious - crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. Carrot cake was monstrously huge and delicious. First off, I will say that I just moved here from California and was a big patron at the Rockbottom in Long Beach. I came to the Homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Rockbottom is a chain brewery, so a lot was the same... the menu, the food prices (yet beer is cheaper, and I am fine with that). I have always found their food to be pricey, but they use excellent ingredients and it has always been tasty and filling so I am fine with that. The food here was just as good as the Long Beach location, so I have no problem with the chef at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "Service was good, our waitress was very friendly and helpful. I wish that they had asked us if we wanted to sit in the bar since happy hour was still going, but that isn't a big thing. Went to the bar to get a drink and had to wait awhile to get the bartender's attention, but he was very friendly and I got a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learned I had just moved here... I really enjoyed that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beer: We got the beer sampler to try the whole list... and, well... I found the dark beers a bit lacking in comparison. The light beer and the wheat were amazing, very impressed. The pale was ok, as was the velvet pale that was one of the specials of the night... but both were way too citrusy. The Uppity IPA was very good... I don't usually like IPAs because the hops overpowers all flavor but the brewer had a good balance. Still, couldn't do a whole glass. I felt the Imperial Stout had a bitter burned taste that was overpowering... I almost want to say the batch had too much chocolate malt in it (not ice cream malt, for the non-homebrewers). The brown and amber were decent, but bland. I ended up getting an actual glass of the light beer and was able to finish it all without forcing it.... one point up on Long Beach, who had a good light but the aftertaste got to you before the glass was empty.\n",
      "\n",
      "I REALLY wanted to try the Das Gut Dopplebock, but they were out. Looks like they will have it in bottles to go soon so I hope I can catch that. Also want to try the Snow Moon Belgian.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verdict: While I was not too impressed with the dark beers, I found the lighter ones very good and I look forward to trying the other seasonal beers. It is a good hour drive south to get there, so I won't be going too often, but I will be back. Even since Rock Bottom opened (7 years ago???) I have always thought it was a dance club.  I am not really sure why but I thought it was along the same line as (throw back) Hi-Tops but I did. I think I always thought this place was a club because of the behemoth size of the space. \n",

      "I started off with one of their wheat beers, it was alright. I nursed it all through dinner so I don't think I was head over heels in love with it.  I got the Catch of the Day, Off the Hook, Fish Dish, Sailors Delight or something(I forget it had some cheesy fish themed name).  It was cod (meh, that should have been the sign not to get it) with roasted asparagus and lemon rice.  The fish was suppose to be broiled but it had a thick breading (annoyed) and the portion of fish was tiny. The rice and asparagus were great though. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend got a chicken sandwich which he enjoyed although the fries were pathetic.  The fries were probably pre-cut frozen fries or just very poorly executed.  They were so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor.\n",

      "Pros: A lot of tables (no wait), brew special beers, big menu, could hear the dueling piano bar next door\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Place was fairly empty and we got a crappy table by the door when it was 5 degrees outside, most of the food was fried, cheese filled, cream based, or wrapped in bacon.  I know some people love to eat food like this all the time( I do every once in awhile) but if you eat out a lot you can't always get the spin dip, burger, and ice cream sundae.  (I would love to but its just not in my cards). I do like like when causal places offer some healthy options. Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger, you can create your own from veggie, turkey, or fresh ground beef. Had a fresh ground beef and the meat was fresh and cooked perfectly with a fresh bun.\n",

      "The brew pub is nice and was surprised it wasn't busier. Here's the trick to enjoying a meal at Rock Bottom: don't get fancy with your food order.  Stick with the sandwiches, salads, burgers, and bar food; and you'll be OK.  I've had bad experience will all the fish dishes (including the fish and chips).  Also, I've found the service is generally better in the bar area than the dinner area.  Join the Mug Club, even if you don't go often, and rack up points for free mugs and beers.  Thursdays are Trivia Nights and the DJ is playing the music loud, so go if you don't really want to have a conversation with the person you're with :) Beer selection was good, but they were out of the ones we wanted. 4 of the 6 people in our group ordered steaks all of them were cooked to their satisfaction. The bourbanzola was a good addition. Defiantly a place I would go again. Joe, our server, was awesome and super friendly. I love this place!  Great atmosphere and friendly service every time I go!! Rock Bottom is a nice hangout place. Often when you are out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from screaming over all of the background noise. Great if your out to see a band, but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sitting around you. \n",

      "Depending on your mood you can sit in the dining area full of booths and tables. It's alittle separated from the main bar area so provides for a semi quiet dining area. The bar area gives you a choice of sitting at the surrounding tables with waitress service or hanging out at the bar itself. Complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brews cold and the ever entertaining company of your favorite bartender. When the weather cooperates the outdoor patio houses about 6 tables for outdoor dining. The view however...not so picturesque, just the entrance to the Improv. Which hey, that could be the perfect seat if you're stocking the local comics! \n",

      "The menu is pretty decent with burgers that are cooked to order with the choice of either steak , veggie or chicken. They have a number of specialty burgers with different cheeses, toppings and creative themes. The bourbonzolla is a tasty burger with a Bourbon based glaze and Gorgonzola cheese. Appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp. Steaks, pasta and salads with rotating specials from different areas of the menu. \n",
      "\n",

      "As an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! \n",

      "The food is good, but the Ball Park Pretzels with Spicy Spinach Cheese dip is the best. The wait staff is generally pleasant and on top of things, a few servers are excellent. I am not a beer drinking so I haven't tried the microbrews but the mixed drinks I've had have been good and a few of thier specials perfect. \n",

      "\n",
      "First surprise: decent beer.  I remembered the normal RB Brewery beers were not much to write home about but they had a couple of new styles, including a very good imperial IPA that for $5/glass cannot be beat.  Second surprise: pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than I expected.  Recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna - both were great. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was a little slow (not sure why) so a 4-star review is downgraded to 3.5. I'll be back next time I'm in Pittsburgh for work. The beer is good. Their light beer, Lumpy Dog, is very good-- doesn't taste like a light beer. When I was pregnant I became quite a fan of their root beer floats, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "As others have noted, the pretzels are really good. I'm not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband likes it. Veggie burgers are always good, too, though the staff sometimes seems confused when you order, say, the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger. Long, long ago, when I used to go to the Rock Bottom in Boston, there was a hot mushroom / sundried tomato / cheese dip on the menu that was fantastic... if they resurrect that I will gladly add another star! I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food, but in my opinion, I feel the bar is raised for places like this. It seems there are so many breweries out there that offer great beer, and slack off on the food. Unfortunately Rock Bottom is one that falls into that category. Let's be honest, when you go to a brewery, you want the full experience. If it was only about the beer, I'd go buy a growler and take it home. \n",
      "\n",
      "So, about the beer....EXCELLENT!!!!! The Jagoff IPA is with out a doubt one of the best IPAs I have ever had! They only I can think of that I think is better is Dogfish Head, but that's a matter of opinion. The beer selection is constantly changing, and they always have some excellent seasonal beers. You can't go wrong, there's bound to be a beer everyone will like. \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the food.......it's pretty much a crap shoot. Sometimes it's good, sometimes it's terrible. My biggest problem is there is absolutely no consistency when it comes to the food. One time it's perfect, then maybe it's cold, or it's burned, or it tastes completely different from the last time you had it. Unfortunately, it seems there is zero attention to food quality. \n",
      "\n",
      "That's pretty much it. This place fixes it's food consistency, and it's a five star place. Till then, it's hit or miss! I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out, not so much.  It was okay.  No better than TGIFridays, but better than Eat n Park!  The deets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The hubster and I were here on a Saturday evening after a show at the Improv so we were happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eats.  We ordered drinks.  He a wheat beer of their brewing, me my fave Bloody Mary with Absolut Peppar.  The hubster deemed the beer acceptable, but wouldn't go out of his way to come back just for another one....yes, he DID order another one \"just to be sure.\"  My Bloody sucked.  Watered down tomato juice with no discernible Peppar of any kind, let alone any other seasonings.  Even a good standard mix would have been better.  Our very efficient and friendly waitress took it back and watched while it was remade by the other bartender.  Nope, no better at all.  That went back and I went with a you-can't-screw-it-up Amaretto sour.  It was fine.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hub ordered a Reuben - why, I'll never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what used to be at the long-lamented Gazebo in Shadyside.  You younguns wouldn't have a clue of the establishment of which I speak.  He said this one was \"fine.\"  I had the Texas Fire steak with jalapeno butter which I enjoyed very much!  Packed a punch of heat and flavor, but the sides were uninspired.  Steamed veggies.  Any flavor was steamed out in the process - eh.  Cheddar mashed potatoes - there was cheddar in there?????  No way!\n",
      "\n",
      "The tab was reasonable - we DID have a Living Social deal that took $30 off, so our check was for $12 and change, not including tip.  Not bad (even with the $15 cost of the LS Deal), but had we paid full price, it wouldn't have been worth the experience.  We'll hit the Improv again - we have before - but, we'll head somewhere else afterwards. I must admit, I do like the brews.  I also like the white cheddar mash potatoes.  Other than that, meh.  The food is pretty forgettable.  Another \"brewery\" that sadly fails to be anything special in the food department.  With the restaurants upping the ante on 8th Ave, you may want to kick it up a notch Rock Bottom.  But how would anyone know to?  It's a chain.  Whomp whomp! For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95. Dined in twice, food ok, atmosphere good. I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \"surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \"chain\", you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds.  But I've really had a lot of good meals at Rock Bottom.  Now, granted, you do owe it to yourself when ordering to not forget where you are (a \"bar-straunt\" if you will), and don't get anything above and beyond this place's call of duty.  For instance, I will never be ordering the ahi tuna.  I'll leave that to my favorite sushi bars and restaurants a bit closer to the water (the Mon doesn't count.....).\n",
      "\n",
      "But besides that, I always really enjoy my meal choices.  I've recently gotten the chicken avocado sandwich.  Chicken was grilled perfectly, plenty of avocado, and it was a good sized sandwich without being excessive.  I've also ordered the Margherita pizza, which could definitely be split between two people.  It's an eight cut that comes to you on a big wooden pizza paddle.  The pizza was really great.  The crust was crispy, it had a good balance of cheese and tomatoes, and the basil pesto was fresh and tasty.  And not greasy whatsoever - BIG bonus points there.  But my biggest surprise as of late was when I ordered their chicken flautas.  I'm a HUGE Mexican food fan and always hesitate to order Mexican outside of a Mexican restaurant for fear of being disappointed.  But I had an insatiable craving one night and decided to go for it.  It was DELICIOUS.  The flautas are deep fried which gives you an amazing crunch, and they still managed to not dry out the inner ingredients.  The accompanying rice was nice and moist as well.  I was so happy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I've always been quite happy with the service there as well.  I go on Thursday evenings for trivia, and nine times out of ten the service is really spot on.  The ladies servicing the bar area are friendly and attentive.  Only once or twice, to my memory, has my service been sub-par, and that can usually be chalked up to an extremely packed Trivia Night with only two visible servers helping 50+ people.\n",
      "\n",
      "I definitely give Rock Bottom two thumbs up for taking your typical chain-found food and making it fresh, yummy, and worth coming back for more. I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend, and it was \"nice\" to see that nothing has changed in the year or two since my last visit. While the beer is pretty good, it has never outweighed the fact that the service isn't good and the food is average, at best.\n",
      "\n",
      "It was even difficult to get beers at the bar...we tried to have the girls order, thinking they'd have better luck...when that failed, the men tried...that didn't work either. If we hadn't REALLY wanted a cold beer after a comedy show at The Improv, we would've just left. It definitely wasn't busy enough to be noticed and ignored by the bartender, so I can't overlook it. Of course, the service has always been spotty at Rock Bottom, so it was hardly surprising.\n",
      "\n",
      "Combine the weak food and poor service with Rock Bottom being too far from home for a night out just to drink, and you get the exact formula that's kept me from going there in the past...and will keep me from going often in the future. Happy hour at Rock Bottom, 2 thumbs up!  Good prices, the pizza is delicious, drinks are a few dollars off the regular price, good service, and the atmosphere is always casual and fun. The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \"eh\", not many vegetarian options and hostesses who will ignore you because they are too busy chatting about who didn't text them back. This place has the potential to be great, but sadly, it falls way too short in almost all areas. Watch the fat girls in here. They will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he goes to the bathroom & then the indignent fat girl had to get yelled at in front of everyone w/ in ear shot. Everything else including the burger & beers I devoured was excellent. Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected, the bar was lively, the food was good, and the service was accommodating,  The beers are better than Church Brew Works and the bar was populated.  The bartender readily offered a taste of beer and gave us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl.  \n",
      "I vote for Rock Bottom as the anchor store of the Water Works. I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well, either way, it's been awhile.  So with my gift certificate I took my brother out for a birthday dinner.  \n",
      "\n",
      "As I get older, my tolerance for things like crowds and youngsters gets lower and lower.  As a result, I told my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the Waterfront before everyone goes out for date night.  Plus the Pirates were playing at 4:05 so we could enjoy our beers and the game.\n",
      "\n",
      "When we arrived, the bar side was already pretty packed but we were still able to get a table.  Our server was very attentive, friendly and helpful.  Right off the bat we both ordered samplers so we could try all of their beers.  We loved the fact that as she approached our table with a full tray of samples our server said, \"I have to go back for the rest.\"  In all we were served 10 different beers each (in 3 oz glasses, maybe 4 - I can never tell).  I gotta say, Rock Bottom knows their beer.  I liked more than I didn't, and very few were not to my liking.  So the $6.95 10 beer sampler was well worth it.  \n",
      "\n",
      "During our sampling we indulged on some Southwest Egg Rolls.  They were okay, but not quite what I expected.  The spicy ranch was top notch, though.  As we ran out of beer, we each ordered up a Kobe Burger.  They were both cooked exactly to our liking (medium).  And to top off our wonderful evening, the Pirates brought home a win!\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaint, as a beer drinker, is the cost for a growler.  The glass container itself is sold for $12.95.  That's the empty price.  To me, that's a little ridiculous when East End only charges $3 for the bottle and Penn Brewery $5.  Paying more for the bottle than the beer inside seems like insanity to me.  So I walked out empty handed.    But it won't deter me from returning. I just came here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer, and I have to admit that I was pretty satisfied with what we got.  Though I couldn't find any fried pickles or onion rings on the apps section, there were some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot.  The atmosphere of this seems pretty cool, especially in the pub area. Fish tacos were excellent!! Great brewed beers on tap as well!!!!!! I very much enjoyed my first visit here. I got the Turkey Meatloaf and it was really tasty. It's more sausage than turkey. The cheesy mashed potatoes were excellent. The star of the night was the appetizer, the artichoke and crab dip. It was awesome. My only complaint was I ordered a Red Ale and they were out. I had the Curmudgeon instead and it was very good, but still. Slow service\n",
      "Below average food \n",
      "Ill pass First time I was here I had chicken quesadilla's and they were bad.  We went again last weekend. I had the chicken avacod sandwich.  It was very good.  No fat in the chicken.  Just a mess to eat, but still awesome.   Also had the chocolate stout cupcake, it was amazing. Thanks to the staff here\n",

      "Cool with our whole mess*\n",

      "*rock bottom allowed our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphaned us Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places, but if you're with a group that doesn't do anything more adventurous, you'll do fine here. I vacillated between 2 and 3 stars but the house beer I had will make sure I come back from time to time. Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! \n",
      "\n",
      "Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos, pepper jack cheese, pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup. It was delish! The ketchup was so good and the fries were extremely crispy. \n",
      "\n",
      "The prices are a little steep for lunch but if you go on Monday, it's totally worth it. I think that the quality of food more than makes up for it but don't expect for pay under $10 for a sit down. \n",
      "\n",
      "I felt that the staff was very nice and the waitress was very attentive. The service was quick and I think you can get in and out in under an hour. Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that, in my opinion, is just \"OK\".  The restaurant is rather large with lots of seating and a pool table. They have many of their own brews that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them are that good. I have had several of their beers and all of them have been forgettable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their food is pretty much like their beers, forgettable. I have had one of their burgers and their pizza and they really weren't anything to write home about.\n",
      "\n",
      "I feel they will impress those who have never been to a brew pub but I would probably describe them as the Chili's of Brew Pubs. If you are in homestead and are looking for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite, or at least until the Burgatory opens! Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened, otherwise I'd be fine giving this place a 3.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our waiter was very attentive and kept our water and soda cups refilled, the food was decent overall - I had a plain ol' burger and a delicious berry sangria - and the place overall had a nice vibe to it and was pretty comfortable and fun to be in...you'd think this would just be another average place not-great-but-not-bad and I'd be ready to go on to the next review right there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's where I ran into problems. I'd checked the website in advance to try and plan my meal since I do my best to pick items on menus that aren't, say, 2,000 calories in one sitting. Their website advertises that they make skinny drinks; when I asked my waiter he said it was possible but that they did not normally do this and that it's a hassle for the people at the bar, so he didn't recommend it. Then why tell us on your website that you'll do it??? \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, while we had checked in advance when we made our reservation about bringing a birthday cake and the restaurant's ability to handle us lighting candles, apparently there was a break down in communication; we never got the candles we had asked for, and in fact the poor waiter struggled to even find a lighter before realizing there were no candles available. Obviously whatever error occurred wasn't the waiter's fault, and we definitely thanked him and tipped him well for doing the best that he could with what he had.\n",
      " \n",
      "On a final note, this is also one of those places where if you ask for a medium rare burger, they will overcook it; I've started ordering medium rare on purpose specifically so that I get a medium cooked burger instead of medium well or well done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final verdict: go for the brews if you must, and the food's nice enough. I was admittedly left a little underwhelmed. Mostly come here for the beer and sports. Fun place! Nothing special. Just like Applebee's, Chili's or Fridays. Stick to the bar food (burgers, sandwiches, pizza, wings and salads) and you will be okay. \n",
      "\n",
      "This was our second attempt at trying Rock Bottom on Fathers Day. The first time almost ten years ago. We went in the early afternoon and they had already ran out of steaks. How do you do that on Fathers Day?! This time we went around 12 noon and beat the rush.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife got and loved the Berry Bash Sangria. She just said it had too much ice in it. Our daughter got the root beer float which she love and I started with a Mango Ice Tea, but later switched for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasn't sweet enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "We started off the the Kobe beef sliders as our app. It took at least 15 minutes to get them. You get three sliders and they were very good.\n",
      "\n",
      "My wife got a small greenhouse salad with Jalapeno ranch dressing to start off with which she enjoyed and the lobster & shrimp enchiladas as her main entree. She complained about how salty it was and the fact that there was no lobster in it at all.\n",

      "Our daughter got the kids burger and fries. No surprise there.\n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the New York Strip with mashed potatoes and it came with green bean as well. My strip was cooked perfectly and has a decent taste. Longhorn has a much, much better quality of steak though. The green beans were pretty good and my mashed potatoes very bland and pretty average. \n",
      "\n",
      "The kitchen sounded like an live episode of Hell's Kitchen. The waiters were repeatedly asking for orders at least 5 to 6 times. The kitchen was backed up the whole time we were there.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a different note, our waitress Susan was very good. Come here for drinks and the bar food. Skip everything else. I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer, so I was really really excited to have my bridal shower there.  My maid of honor reserved the banquet room which was very nice and separated from the rest of the restaurant.  My MOH and mother said that the person they talked to about reservations and arrangements was wonderful and easy to get in touch with.  My shower was wonderful, the wait staff was great and kept everyone's glasses full.  It started pouring down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gifts wouldn't get wet when taking them out to the car.  The only reason this place gets 4 stars is because we were not allowed to take our leftover food from the buffet home.  There was salmon, chicken, potatoes, and mac and cheese left over and they told us we couldn't box it up.  Not sure why- they can't re-serve it!  It would have just gone to waste!\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, not at all related to the shower, their trivia night is super fun! Southwest Egg rolls and Fish tacos. Mmmmmmmmm. Ohh and the AMAZING Brews! I rarely give a business a superior rating, but I have to say my wife and I had one of the best dining experiences at the Rock Bottom Brewery.   The food was delicious,  the beer, every recipe sampled,  was amazing and the service was wonderful.  The staff made us feel like we were the most important guests in the restaurant. \n",
      "\n",
      "Please support this business.  I guarantee you will not be disappointed. I'm giving 4 stars mostly because of the beer....large selection & decent prices.   The food is pretty good, but nothing to rave about.  The menu has a good variety, and everything I've tried has been good.  Portions are large.  \n",

      "One side of the restaurant is the bar & bar atmosphere....with several TV's & 2 pool tables.  It's very wide open with extremely high ceilings.  The other side is more for families or people who aren't concerned about watching sports.  In general, it has a relaxed atmosphere.  I've always had quick & friendly service.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I love the whole Waterfront area....so much to do! I'm not much of a beer drinker, but my fiancee is a major enthusiast, so I agreed to tag along.  I'm glad I did!  Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the extensive house-brewed beer selection, and helped me to pick one I would love (the kolsch was very crisp, light, and drinkable.)  The food was standard pub fare with a twist, well-executed.  My burger was topped with onion petals and gorgonzola, and cooked to perfection.  The waitress recommended their macaroni and cheese for a side, which was definitely a good choice.  My only complaint is that most of the food was rather heavy, and I spent the rest of the night wallowing on the couch.  Not sure I would make the hour+ trip to Pittsburgh again, but if I found myself in the city, I may just stop by. Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing. Normally the food is outstanding, no more salted bread sticks, but they did bring back the ball park pretzels.  Not very good, cool to low warm. Hard, dense.  Mango ice tea is wonderful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will see how the chicken comes out.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be continued... Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff, and neither of us had ever been there, so we gave it a go.\n",
      "\n",
      "We walked in around 8pm and we were told that there would be an hour long wait. We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\n",
      "\n",
      "Our server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\n",
      "\n",
      "We started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \n",
      "\n",
      "Tom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party... Yuck.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, we might come back for the beer and service, but not for the food. And DEFINITELY not to use the bathroom... I'm a regular here since their kitchen is open late and it's a good option after movies. Their nachos is pretty good. I also tried their burger and chicken sandwiches and they're good as well. \n",
      "I think the only thing I did't like is the steak taco appetizer. It was too sour and kinda tasteless. The Cajun Pasta I ordered was just spicy enough to keep me sipping my Rock Bottom IPA. It may be a chain but I always get that microbrew restaurant feel when I'm here. They could upgrade the quality of the servers but I've never had a really bad experience with the service. I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly. So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront, we headed to Rock Bottom for some late night grub.  The place was pretty busy, we had to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple told us they were about to leave and we could have their bar table.  As nice as this was of them it was awkward standing over them as they finished their drinks paid their bill and left.  \n",
      "\n",
      "So finally seated I look over the drinks and being the huge IPA lover that I am I went with that and it was indeed a good choice.  The hubby had the Red Ale which was also rather good.\n",
      "\n",
      "The service was OK, not the best not the worst.  But moving on to more important thing, the food.  Talk about missing the mark hugely!  I ordered the mini street fish tacos.  You get four mini tacos with a marinated in lime piece of fish, and tomatillo salsa.  They were just strokes away from inedible.  I love fish tacos, I mean it is such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time executing this dish? The shells were hard and literally split at the bottom when I picked them up.  The sour cream sprayed all over the plate only made them messy and the poor fish was just so overcooked.  If I wasn't so hungry I wouldn't have eaten them at all! Lesson learn on that.\n",
      "\n",
      "The husband had the BBQ Chicken Pizza.  It had beans and corn with roasted red pepper on it along with some sour cream.  My husband is usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizza's and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings!  For instance, he would usually just say, Chicken BBQ and cheese, nothing else!  I refused to let him do that this time, because I was really intrigued in the combination of ingredients on this pie.  And boy was I jealous when it came out.  It blew my crappy tacos out of the water!  Should have stuck with something simple.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore I could care less if I come back to this location.  The beers were good but hell you can get a decent IPA just about anywhere anymore.  And the underwhelming food sealed the deal.  I know this is a chain, but it still doesn't have to stink... the food was delicious. portion size generous. atmosphere good. Our waitress Lindy was outstanding. Have nothing but good things to say. Would highly recommend to everyone ! Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience. I have to say that I've only been here when it was very busy. I found the service fairly quick and any of the food I've had has been delicious. I went there tonight and there was an issue with my food. Without going into detail, I will say they handled it wonderfully. Our waitress Mallory was very kind and she was quick to fix the problem. I had the salmon for the second time and it was just as amazing as it was the first time. I had one beer that's similar to a blue moon and that was good too. I would go back again! My husband and I got here a couple times a year.    Always (except my veggies today) get great food at a decent price.   I love their side salad..... which has raisins and sunflower seeds.    Burgers are great and my husband loves their chicken Mac and cheese.   Recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat. Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes, I had to TRY and give them money.\n",
      "\n",
      "On to the important part... Food was terrible. I had a burger and it was pathetic. On a glorious day in the month of May , my love and I stumbled hungrily into rock bottom.  Ha. Just kidding I realized Darren W. Hadn't reviewed here so I had to start it cheesy.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The rock bottom line: Monday for lunch we had awesome service by Ashley.  We weren't rushed and it was quite.  The burgers were great and half off . The beer was very good.  We will be returning for sure. Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful, professional, and on point all night. Lauren (one of the managers) was reliable and pleasant throughout the entire planning process. If anyone is looking to plan an event I would highly recommend Rock Bottom. Couldn't be happier! I love this restaraunt. Rarely have I ever received service like I get here. The food is good, definitely reasonable for the price. The thing that blew me away was the fact that my steak was cooked TO TEMPERATURE. This rarely ever happens at restaraunt of similar price range and quality. But the servers are fantastic. Very attentive, polite and timely. The beer selection is awesome, we always order the sampler. I like having lots of options as far as beverages go. The wait time isn't terrible if you go a little later on a friday or Saturday night. And they most often call you before the quotes time. The desert menu is a little small, but I could probably skip it anyways ;)  the ambiance is good, not to crammed or noisy. They also have outside seating available when the weather is nice I highly recommend this establishment! I love this place! Great food and the best beer brewed on site! The bourbonzola burger is the best thing you can order here. The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports, the music is nice and pretty mellow and the place is very spacey and the prices are pretty reasonable. And most importantly is the place seems to be kept clean at all times. Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans, rolled oats and veggies. The chipotle mayo really gave it that oomph. My burger was more than enough for me to handle and everything was worth the price. As for drinks, I'm a complete noob when it comes to beer but my friend ordered a tap and even from a small taste, I could tell it was very good quality beer. Bitter and sweet, with a slight tang. I rarely drink beer but i I'm going to, then might as well drink the best kind there is - fresh and microbrewed.\n",
      "\n",
      "NOTE: There aren't too many options for vegetarians. The veggie burger was pretty good and I'd recommend it, but other than that, there's also the veggie tacos, a few select appetizers, and a few salads from which to choose. I've never been crazy about the food here, but my friend likes it, so I do eat here once in a while. We stopped in last night and I had the chicken finger appetizer with fries. The food was a little overcooked and nearly tasteless. The ranch dressing was barely good enough to make up for it. \n",
      "\n",
      "My friend had the mac & cheese with chicken and bacon, which is what she orders just about every time she's there. It looked delicious and the portion was huge. I'll be trying this dish next time we're there. \n",
      "\n",
      "We've also had the Ball Park Pretzels in the past, and they're really good. \n",
      "\n",
      "I'm giving 4 stars because the service was great, there's outdoor seating, and the Berry Bash Sangria was delicious (if expensive). We'll be back. Every time I've been here the food has always been delicious and the service has always been very exceptional. My go to is the Laredo burger and the Mac n'cheese as a side. They Mac n' cheese is absolutely wonderful if you like garlic! I've had a few other menu options as well that have been superb. The beers on tap are always great. My newest favorite is the First! Pumpkin Ale. \n",
      "\n",
      "One thing I really appreciate about Rock Bottom is that they aren't one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when you're done eating. The food comes out fast (which is great when you're starving!) but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eating companions there's never any rush. I was just at Rock Bottom last night meeting friends for a movie that didn't start until 11pm. We got at the restaurant around 7:30, ordered drinks, ate and had a few more drinks and then just hung out for about a half hour until it was time to Walk over to the cinemas. It was nice not feeling rushed to leave as soon as we stopped ordering.\n",
      "\n",
      "My only complaints are that sometimes meat ends up being cooked a little more than you often ask. Medium often turns into medium well, but that's not a huge problem for me. I also don't think the signature cocktails are worth $9, but that's more of a corporate complaint since Rock Bottom is a small chain. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall I definitely recommend eating here if you're in the Waterfront! The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The Kölsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good, but the wait for food or a table can be quite long (generally 20-30 minutes even for just beer and apps).  I've been to the one at the Denver airport as well, but I was stranded and had free meal tickets, so okay-but-nothing-special pizza from Rock Bottom it was.  Since it's a recognizable national chain, I think of places like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true Pittsburgh craft-brew experience. The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu, and if you have developed a \"foodie\" palate, don't even bother, because you will be very disappointed. If you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch (which, nothing wrong with that!) you will most likely enjoy Rockbottom. The only entree I did enjoy were the lobster and shrimp enchiladas (minus the repulsive beans and rice) and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer. Otherwise, you are better off skipping it. This place is quite big with a bar area, dining room area, and patio area. We decided to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many TV's. They also have darts and two pool tables, which I really enjoy. When you are in the bar area you can see the beer being brewed through the window which is really cool. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ordered the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend ordered the white wheat, both of which are brewed by Rock Bottom. They both tasted delicious and were exactly what I needed for a hot day. My friend ordered the Fried chicken entree which came with mashed potatoes and of course she gave me a few bites since we always share. It was a pretty delicious meal, but the fried crust fell off a few pieces which I am not really a fan of. I ordered the Sante fe salad with grilled chicken not fried. The salad was okay I was expecting more flavors overall, but I didn't really get them. \n",
      "\n",
      "It was a good experience and will most likely be back when I am around the waterfront area. I am not a fan of chain restaurants typically and had to slowing break my boyfriend from wanting to eat at chain restaurants all of the time. The one chain that I can't break from is rock bottom. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their beer is always good- as far as their staples go, I really love their white ale. Their seasonal IPAs have been good and my favorite seasonals of all time included their chocolate raspberry stout (...yes, it tasted as good as it sounds; they had it last year around Christmas) and their smoky BBQ brown ale (tasted like summer, complemented BBQ amazingly ; they had it this past summer, I bought a growler of it lol). \n",
      "\n",
      "As far as their food goes, I typically stay away from the appetizers. $10 and up is a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go. I've had their southwestern rolls and they were good but not worth $10. \n",
      "\n",
      "Almost every time I go I order the Baja chicken sandwich. It's my favorite chicken sandwich! So good. The chicken is actually grilled (which goes for all of their chicken sandwiches) and I love the charred flavor that it has. The bun is soft but sturdy and doesn't fall apart while eating the sandwich, the sauce is amazing, the onion frizzles are the best and last but not least... There's a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich. Mhm! I love it. My boyfriend usually gets the hickory BBQ bacon chicken sandwich and loves it as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "Another item I ALWAYS get... Their apple coleslaw. I've yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant. So simple, yet oh so good. \n",
      "\n",
      "They also recently changed their fries and these are much better than their old ones. \n",
      "\n",
      "Their side salads are awesome as well. They are decent in size- spring mix topped with sunflower seeds, raisins, half of a hard boiled egg (which I give to the boyfriend), chopped cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons. Yum! \n",
      "\n",
      "I usually order the same thing every time I go. I steered off my normal path once and ordered the buffalo Mac and cheese and found it to be quite tasteless. Which turned me off to trying new items there. Plus I am just too in love with the Baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is always great, the bartenders are friendly... I love this place. Ask about their rock bottom rewards ! Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives, and the management cares even less. I want to make sure people know how careless the management is, particularly Mark who seems to let his staff run around. I always enjoy Rock Bottom. Standard beers on tap are always great and their rotating selection usually has a hit as well. \n",
      "\n",
      "I prefer the bar seating as to the dining room, but this is a good way to separate the family dining from those of us without kiddos. \n",
      "\n",
      "Nachos, nachos, nachos. Truly the best in the area. Great burgers, chili and salads. Really...I don't think I've had a bad meal here. Nice outdoor seating in the summer. \n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great place to watch a game or just hang out. Iced counter at the bar to keep your drink cold.  I know they have other cocktails here, but I can't order them at a beer place. I've seen them and they do look good, but I'm stuck to the beer selection. \n",
      "\n",
      "They have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service is always great whether there are two or 10 of us. This is  a \"Okay\" place to eat.  The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  Rice (Cajun Taco) was not cooked well.  Would I go there again \"maybe\".  If your into beer and watching the game, then yeah go there. BALL PARK PRETZEL-Would eat again. \n",
      "\n",
      "I came to rock bottom, looking for a great beer. Full of hops, that brings a refreshing sensation and satisfaction. I then opened the menu, scanned looking for those select bar items to pair with my great beer. I saw an extensive list of items, from chicken fingers to salads. I noticed a Ball Park Pretzel, with a jalapeño cheese dip. I was blown away, the fact that I got 2 pretzels amazed me. I ordered within 25 minutes of seating. My pretzels hit the table within minutes. The smell of the warm salt and hot cheese opened my senses. But I knew we could step this shit up, I asked for mustard. And what do you know. Grey Poupon Dijon Mustard is in front of my eyes. I combined that shit and life evolved. I went to heaven, it took me 35 minutes to write this review because I took a solid bite with Grey Poupon after each sentence. Good look Rock Bottom, keep up the good work. The Improv Comedy Club at The Waterfront is the best comedy club in Pittsburgh because there is only one other one and this one gets more famous comedians. I go there just about every other week.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros: Great comedians all year round! The food/drinks are very good and the wait staff is wonderful! The Improv is a great venue for upcoming and new comedians, I always see new, local talent opening for national comedians. In one show you will see 1-2 local comedians, and 1-2 national touring comedians. The Improv has a nice environment inside with general admission seating (first come, first serve). The EMAIL LIST is essential in order to receive free ticket packages and perks, as well as reminders of upcoming comedians!\n",
      "\n",
      "Cons: Prices can be steep (it is expensive/difficult to be a regular). Food and Drinks are not cheap (no specials). Expect to pay $15- $40 for tickets depending on the headliner with a two item minimum. Waiting in line before the shows wouldn't be bad if you weren't forced to stand outside in any and all weather conditions. If it is raining and you'd like a good seat, you will pay the price. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall: This 21+ venue is a great place to spend a night out with friends or loved ones. You may buy tickets in advance online/phone or buy your tickets at the box office at the location. I highly recommend joining the mailing list to receive free tickets! Check the calendar for upcoming shows and open mic nights during the week! Support local comedy, and enjoy The Improv at the Waterfront! Good club for a good laugh. High food prices (most comedy clubs are), 2 item min. The food was less than stellar. I wouldve enjoyed Burger King more. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service was decent, I believe the waiters/waitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiters/waitresses. I get grouchy when my glass is sitting empty for more than 2 mins. They have good acts coming around here, and often give out free tickets, particularly ine summer. I've never actually paid full price for a ticket here. \n",
      "\n",
      "The two-item minimum is bit bothersome to me though...I don't mind the requirement so much, but the quality isn't good and the prices are high. Our four items total came to about $30 (two appetizers and two beers) and the apps were really nothing to write home about and the servers aren't even very friendly. Also beware...they have a lot of rules here. They won't seat till the whole party is there; if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party HAS to order dinner, automatic gratuity added to the check, etc. etc.\n",
      "\n",
      "The \"box office\" is also weird...you get your tickets at this window complete with microphone and slide-under slot...then you walk into the club and the box office is completely open and the workers are just sitting right there, so I don't get the whole hoopla with the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "All in all though, the seats are comfy enough, the atmosphere is pretty nice, and the acts are good. I always enjoy a good comedy club and though I'm a loyal Helium fan, I gotta give props to the Improv near Pittsburgh. They chose a great location, with surrounding restaurants of all genres and fun bars and shopping. \n",
      "\n",
      "We bought tickets to see a comedian I had never heard of (he was decent) for $25 each with a two item purchase minimum. I really dislike that rule but you can't really get around it. \n",
      "\n",
      "The only thing I didn't like, aka hated, was having to wait in line outside before the show started. It was freeeeezing! They should put heaters outside. seriously. Came here to see Charlie Murphy. \n",
      "Parking was nightmare. I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night.\n",
      "The 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you don't have to wait outside. Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.\n",
      "Seating is first come first serve.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Server was pretty quick to take our orders. I misread the menu description and didn't realize my BBQ sandwich came \n",
      "with cheese.  I don't eat cheese, and had send my order back. The waiter was gracious and returned with my modified order in about 15 minutes. I've never heard of throwing cheese pulled pork sandwich, maybe it's a northern thing. \n",
      "We got our checks quickly, and without issue. I'm HUGE SNL fan, so naturally if someone who's been in the cast is touring, I'll come here to see them. Some have been really great...Jim Breuer. Some have been (surprisingly) very bad....Tracy Morgan. But it's always been a pleasant experience at the venue.  There's not a bad seat in the house and it's small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage.  Beware if you sit in the very front, you KNOW what's going to happen!\n",
      "\n",
      "A couple downsides.... \n",
      "\n",
      "Waiting outside in a line in the dead of winter.  The lobby is so small you're forced to wait outside until the first show starts or the first show let's out.  And if you want a good seat, you may be waiting in line for a while.  BURR!\n",
      "\n",
      "The two drink minimum. I kinda get why they do it, to make money, of course. But this means they jack up the prices of watered down drinks. Better to stick with beer and wine at these places. No frou frou drinks for me! \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, as to be expected, the food's not that great. In a perfect foodie world, places that served food would make it fantastic! Since that's not going to happen, you just go into those places hoping for the best. I've never had anything great here. Nacho platter too many re fried beans, to little nacho's....annnnnd I'm out! \n",
      "\n",
      "So what did we learn here? Good venue, stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand. The talent is really what you're there for so, enjoy the show! I've been here twice now, and like the others you really only come to Improve Comedy Club for the show. Very reasonably priced for shows  though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The food leaves little to be desired. We decided for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show started at 7. Having a free appetizer coupon we ordered the spinach and artichoke dip along with the sauteed grilled chicken. Spinach and artichoke dip was good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkled on top of the chips. Sauteed grilled chicken - hmmm.... I think the chicken was frozen - definitely not fresh - and the guacamole was artificial with a glop of cheese. It looked like a mess with big ole pile of fries. A lot of food for $10. Service has always been pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18%. There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs, a few chuckles and a couple of good guffaws thrown in for good measure.  That's exactly what we enjoyed on Saturday night!\n",
      "\n",
      "We hit the comedy club for an evening of Tammy Pescatelli - the hubby and I have enjoyed her routine on TV and on the occasional DVE morning show..  She didn't fail to give us a good evening of laughs!  The big surprise, was Gene Collier - yep, of the Post-Gazette sports writer fame - as the opener.  What a great opening act!  He cracked wise about the perils of being 58 and a baby boomer.  We could relate!\n",
      "\n",
      "The sightlines were lacking.  There was a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive Pittsburgh BIG HAIR.  All night long my own head bobbed from side to side as I attempted to actually watch the show, and not just listen to it, as she reached repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snacks.  \n",
      "\n",
      "With a 2 drink minimum, my first drink was weak and the 2nd was quite strong!  All in all, the two balanced each other out.  But then, you don't go for the drinks, do you?  An enjoyable evening! Tom Green was appearing here on Jan 22, 2012. He was hilarious. \n",
      "\n",
      "The Improv is an excellent comedy club, in past shows I've seen Jim Krenn, Margaret Cho, Billy Elmer, and so many more I forget. Much like Live from the Improv on TV, the brick back drop makes it feel like the NYC Improv. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hint: eat elsewhere, the food isn't so great, have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant, most comedians head over to the Rock Bottom after to imbibe. Dave Attell is a regular at both places. Two drink minimum, drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show. Decent, clean (as far as I could sense in the dim)... about on par for what you'd expect for a higher-end comedy club.  That includes the $10/drink, two-drink minimum, automatic 18% gratuity, and the comic spouting out the obligatory, \"don't forget to tip your waitress.\"\n",
      "\n",

      "Total cash bled out of my pocket brought it down from what could have been a 4-star experience for us.  $80 for tickets online included $10 \"service fee\" and tax (we had to: this was a sold out show).  Add $25 for drinks, gratuity, and more tax.  We're talking 3-digits of $$$ for less than 2 hours of entertainment squeezed in between other patrons and glass-wielding servers while you sit on rickety chairs.  That's what a headliner act will cost ya!\n",
      "\n",
      "Will you see us here again?  Probably... but cost makes it unlikely to be a weekly thing for us. My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd, 2012. At that time, only a few big name comedians were listed on the Improv's website as Special Events. You can use the Groupon on anything that isn't a Special Event. That seemd reasonable. The day the Groupons were purchased, my friend Katrina called & reserved two tickets to Jim Jeffries for 3/30 at 10pm. They allowed her to use her Groupon & gave her a confirmation code & everything! Shortly after, they changed many of the comedians on their website, including Jim Jeffries, to Special Events. When I called I was told I could not use my Groupon. The same thing happened to many of my friends. It's a classic bait & switch. These comedians were NOT Special Events until after the Groupon came out. In addition, other restrictions, such not being able to use the Groupons on Saturdays & having to use the additional four vouchers for one show, were NOT listed under the restrictions when the Groupon was for sale. \n",
      "\n",
      "So tonight, my friends & I had pretty much resolved ourselves to the fact that we were not going to the Improv because they wouldn't allow us to use our Groupons. But I walked over to the Will Call window with my friend Katrina so she could at least get her tickets. Big surprise - she was told they didn't have her reservation or her name in their computers! They wouldn't give her the tickets. It's an absolute joke of a deal. How is everyone going to use their Groupons by Sept. if all of the shows are Special Events now? \n",

Even after paying for two very bland, overpriced meals and way too many Diet Cokes, I thought that my bill was rather high.  Upon further inspection, I noticed that my server had taken an 18% gratuity.  The menu explicitly says that an automatic gratuity will be taken out for parties of six or more, but there was only two of us and we weren't even drunk.  I found this tactic awfully presumptuous and left her tip at the 18% even though I typically tip well over 20%.    \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I don't like the idea of being required to purchase food just to see a comedy show.  I can see why they do it, but if I were required to buy a crappy popcorn and overpriced pop every time I went to the movies, I would be far less inclined to go as I am not inclined to go to the Improv again. The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).\n",
      "\n",
      "The setup is nice, a delightful--if a bit sterile--reproduction of what you'd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough TV.  The interior is clean; the seats are comfortable; and it's an OK atmosphere to see a show and laugh.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's too small, however, to attract many of the best acts, which limits its ability to ever become the central hub for Pittsburgh comedy.  Most of the big names that have recently come through Pittsburgh--Jim Gaffigan, Louis CK, Second City--all perform elsewhere (though they managed to get Bob Saget, to their credit).\n",
      "\n",
      "But the biggest problem is the food and drink.  They're very up front about their mandatory two item minimum, but the forced service requires that you spend extra money and get interrupted by waitstaff at least several times during the show.  The prices are well above what I'd consider reasonable given the quality, and I'd begrudgingly--or even happily--just shrug off the cost the same way I would a stadium concession stand markup...but the food is bad.  You're forced to either (a) buy extremely overpriced drinks (3.50 for a soda, for example, with no refills--or ten dollars for one with refills), or (b) buy moderately overpriced food which you wouldn't want in the first place.  I thought the ten dollar chicken sandwich looked reasonable, until a few bites in I decided I'd rather just throw away the money than keep eating it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I think this place has a lot of potential; the core idea is very workable; and they do attract some really good comedians.  Two stars for now, with high hopes for improvements.\n",
      "\n",
      "A few specific drawbacks which could be VERY easily fixed:\n",
      "1 - A lot of the drinks didn't have prices on them.  I know this isn't uncommon, but at a venue where every question you ask interrupts not only your own show-viewing experience as well as the experiences of your neighbors, it's an incredibly poor decision here.  Make everything on the menu exceptionally clear.  It's not that hard.\n",
      "2 - Put the drink prices on the website too.  An Improv representative has personally responded to many of these Yelp reviews, and she once said \"Our menus and pricing are listed on our website, which makes for easy planning!\"  I'm calling shenanigans.  Not all the prices are on the website, which makes for difficult planning.\n",
      "3 - Reminding me to tip my server during the show AND adding an automatic gratuity to the check makes me feel like you're trying to trick me.  It's kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to one's customers.\n",
      "4 - Since the $3.50 soft drinks don't come with free refills, the servers shouldn't ask \"would you like a refill on that?\" or anything of the sort.  They should ask \"would you like another one?\" instead.  They should also respond to requests for refills by saying \"we don't offer refills, but I'd be happy to get you another one.\"  Just because there's a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesn't mean people all figure it out.  Most patrons don't even bother reading the beverage section of the menu if all they want is a standard beverage offered almost everywhere (like a cola or diet cola), and the reading difficulties imposed by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offerings. I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin, Pablo Francisco super funny Tammy Pescatelli not so much.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Things you should be aware of: The staff is really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepared to spend money on the pricey food and drinks. I kinda wish their menu was a little bit more extensive. Their service is spotty\n",
      "\n",
      "The wait staff is a little iffy. I have been here MANY times and sometimes I get an attentive waitress and sometimes not. Most recently our waitress was rude, didn't bother with pleasantries and barely took notice of us. Also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity. If our waitress was nice I would be more than glad to add to it but this time I was like no way!\n",
      "\n",
      "p.s. when I used my groupon I didn't have any trouble My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food, however, is mediocre at best. In addition, we were seated in the last row, and 10 minutes into the headliner they sat someone else at our table, so that they were in front of us. I could not see a thing. When we received our check, they had added an 18% gratuity without permission or notification.  I will not be returning anytime soon. Who doesn't love to laugh? The improv is a great place to go for a good show a few times a year. The venue is clean. The comedians are good, for the price, and many times you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price (i.e.Tommy Johnagin). However, be advised, if you attend more than one show every couple of months, you will see some of the same opening acts repeated. This is my biggest gripe with the Improv. I've been to the Improv about 3 times over the past 4 months and have seen the same opening acts a few times. I think they cycle through the same 4-5 comedians. Are there not more talented comedians in Pittsburgh? As noted in other reviews, another area of improvement is the drinks and food. I always attend the late showing so that I can eat elsewhere. The food is mediocre bar food at best. Nothing more needs to be said about that. I definitely don't mind the two drink minimum. I've been known to consume more than two drinks in one setting but, the drinks are insanely overpriced. $5 for a Miller Lite, $4 for a Snapple, $10 for a fountain drink with refills. You're better off having your two drinks during the show and going over the Sing Sing after for a draft .  . or four. In addition, since they started offering a large Groupon discount, the Improv has been packed. Be aware that if you only have two people in your party, they may seat strangers at your table who are 6 feet tall and block your view. We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged, almost brown iceberg lettuce, with some croutons and frozen-then-thawed looking tomatoes that were pinkish at best. I took a few bites of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad, and I can tell you it was downright tragic. Dinner arrived and since there wasn't any vegetarian options on this predetermined menu, we received a dish that was supposed to contain meat with the meat omitted. It was a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl. It looked sloppy and tasted worse than it looked. The pasta was overcooked, and the tomato sauce was just watered down puréed canned tomatoes. I saw traces of onion in my dish but didn't taste them at all. I was so hungry that I salted the heck out of this abomination and took a few bites. Yuck. I didn't make a dent in this crapfest. For dessert we were given a choice of chocolate cake, which my wife ordered, and cheesecake, which I ordered. The chocolate cake had freezer burn. Inexcusable! It wasn't edible. The cheesecake was only a hair better, but it had obviously come out of the freezer as well. I know people aren't coming here for the food, but if you are FORCING them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements (two drink/two menu item minimum) then at least make some halfway decent food. It doesn't even have to be memorable...just not OFFENSIVE. Which it was!! Had I paid for any of this I would have made a huge stink, but I tried to be polite and push my food around and make small talk. \n",
      "\n",
      "The comedians were good. The venue was nice-ish and we got to sit in the front because we arrived early for our \"event\". Not always the best thing in a comedy club (we only got picked on a little bit). But damn, I was hungry! I found myself fantasizing about all of the crappy Waterfront restaurants and how I'd rather be there...how I'd rather be heating up a discount microwave dinner...how I'd rather have a giant bowl of Captain Crunch...how I'd rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteria...what a dreadful dining experience.\n",

      "My car was also violated in the parking lot. I had an adorable German license plate on the front of my adorable German car which was stolen while I was eating hideous food, which was just the slap in the face I wanted when finally retreating to my car. I feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Improv should consider outsourcing the food prep to a catering company. I truly believe that's the only thing that can save this place. Do yourself a favor and eat beforehand, and just order a beer. Well, two I guess. Other diners at our table complained about the quality of the cocktails so I'd steer clear of those. Unless there is a can't miss type of comedian here, I can't ever picture going back to the Improv. I'd give the comedians 4 stars, and the food ZERO stars.

      "The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building, order drinks then the show finally started at 9:45pm.  The host did offer a blanket apology which was nice but hardly made up for the fact the show started almost an hour late. I have been here twice in the last month. It's a pretty great time. My first visit, the service was pretty poor and the food was cold by the time it got to the table. We had to sit all the way in the back and the comedian was not that good (although that is no fault of the club). But when I went to the second show, the service was much improved. The burger I ordered was fantastic and warm. Our waitress kept the drinks coming without interrupting us while the comedian was on stage. We were also able to sit in the front this time and it was a great experience. I'll be going back soon! Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms, but from what experienced it was great! The drinks were decent, and I  believe you must order two items at minimum. The staff is quick, but they should have more people working on a Saturday night. Before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen.\n",
      "\n",
      "The comics we saw were funny as well. Will definitely go back! I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets. I was so excited when my husband gave me tickets to go here to see funny man Bill Crawford, part of the DVE morning show for those of you who never heard of him.  That is funny because as I was telling people about going it became clear there are A LOT of people that haven't... Oh Well... Let me mention this was my first time there.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I was warned in advance of the possible long waits outside and the two item minimum.  Well to my pleasant surprise there was no wait, walked right in, greeted, an usher showed us to our seats and we waited less than 5 minutes to be asked for our order.  This was nice.  I will say that the show started at 8pm, and we were there by 7:20 or so.  There were already people seated so we were by no means very early, and heck there were people with full course meals and tables of 10.  The price of the mixed drinks were not disclosed on the menu, leading me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month, but they did have a 60 minute dogfish head IPA for $6.00.  Now that may seem rather expensive and it is, but doable so I indeed did it... My husband got a domestic and it was between 4-5 bucks.  We opted not to eat there, as we were going to Rock Bottom after wards and I will get to that review later...\n",
      "\n",
      "So the show was good.  There were moments that I think the comedians may have went off track and were just bantering, but luckily enough they rebound and got back to making everyone laugh instead of being uncomfortable.  There were a total of 4 comedians, the MC, and two opening acts for Crawford.  I actually really enjoyed them.  \n",
      "\n",
      "The one or two things I didn't like about the place.  The bathrooms are in the lobby.  As this seems normal there is no separate area to enter back into the room without having to make your way through people who are waiting to be seated... This was/is stupid.  I was actually nervous that they were going to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secured at my first entrance.  The same also goes for smoking.  Since we were so early I took a break and it was again awkward reentering.  Maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this.  A stamped hand?  A ticket stub?  Not sure but I know I would have felt better unlike feeling like I was sneaking into the place.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I would definitely return to the Improv.  I just hope I always have a rather positive experience! It isn't often that my wife and I get to go out, but we had tickets to see the WONDERFUL Lisa Landry and figured since we were going to the Improv, we may as well eat there too. I should have gotten on here and read the reviews before making that decision. We had what seems to be a typical experience at the improv. We were handed a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walked in the door. There was no other menu at the table and our waitress didn't offer us one either. She wanted our order, but as we were looking around the place, we realized that most of those around us were eating items that not on the menu provided to us. When asked about another menu, our waitress told us if we give her our drink order, she'll see what she can do. The table next to us handed over their menus so we had something to work with. Our drinks came, we finally put our orders in...and that was the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes. When she finally came back, all she wanted was to know if we wanted a 2nd round of drinks. After 30 minutes I was finally going to get a second beer! \"What about our food?\", we asked. \"Oh\", was her answer. Now, according to the menu, dinner came with a side salad, a complimentary glass of champagne, and a chocolate mousse dessert. That's all good and fine. After a couple of minutes, someone, not our waitress, finally brought out our meals. When we asked him about our salads, his reply was \"do you want me to take your food back?\". Really?!?! \"Do you want me to take your food back?\" After almost 45 minutes at this point, we had received 1 round of drinks and had seen our waitress only twice and had just received our food. No, I don't want you to take our food back! Halfway through eating our meals, which were by this time cold, our waitress finally came back with our second beers. She asked us how everything was. We asked about our salads. She said she was told we didn't want them. REALLY?!?! Is this a joke? Is it somehow part of the comedy routine that was going on? Sadly, no. The service didn't get any better. The food was lousy. Thankfully the standup was great. Lisa, Lisa and Matt all put on a hilarious show. Will I ever go back? Don't know. It took us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there, thanks to traffic. I do know that if we do it again, we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else. The two drink minimum works at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drinks. In case you're interested, I am a chef who has been in the service industry for more than 30 years and worked every position possible in restaurants and bars. So, yes, I do have a preconceived notion as to how service and food should be. Even on Valentine's Day. My husband and I love going to comedy shows and have seen some pretty good acts at the Improv. Ticket prices aren't bad either. I am very particular about where I sit, and the person who seats you is willing to let you sit where you choose, especially if it's on a Thursday or Sunday night, since those aren't particularly busy nights.\n",
      "\n",
      "I did have one bad experience, which is why I'm giving this review 3 stars instead of 4 (it only takes one poor experience, people!). My husband and I went to see one of our favorite comedians on a Thursday night. There is a two-item minimum, so we decided we would just eat dinner at the show. Well, we were mistaken. First of all, our waitress was rude and slow. After sitting there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally comes over and asks what we want. We both order a drink and food, to which she tells us that the kitchen caught on fire earlier that day so all they have are salads and desserts. I was annoyed that she even asked what we wanted instead of starting out with this important fact.\n",
      "\n",
      "At any rate, I order a Caesar salad and a beer. It comes out and it's iceburg lettuce with shredded cheese, tomatoes, and other veggies. In other words, a regular salad. I inform the waitress of this and she seemed totally confused. I suppose she did not understand the difference, which was odd. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, I felt that there was no apology for the fact we couldn't eat, let alone everyone else in the place. Salad or dessert aren't the greatest choices when you are expecting to eat dinner at the show. I think the Improv should have waived the two-item minimum on this occasions, even if it cost them money. \n",
      "\n",
      "Afterwards, I emailed the Improv with my concerns. Never. Heard. Back.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, I will most likely return to the Improv....but not for the service. Because it's a great place to see comedy shows and isn't that expensive. Customer service is terrible. I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket, but every person needs to buy 2 items of food/drink and the drinks aren't cheap (around $10-12).  However, I would definitely go back sometime! Wast there last Friday. Seats right in front if the stage. The show was good. The headliner, while a bit long, was good. Fantastic service from our waitresses. Will definitely go back. If The Improv chain didn't bring in such amazing comedians, this place would be totally screwed. \n",
      "\n",
      "I always have fun watching the comedians, but I can't help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place is.\n",
      "\n",
      "First you buy the tickets, but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge. The real kicker is having to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show, beers are $5 or $6 and the cheapest things on the menu, I believe. Cocktails are $11-$13. I think glasses of wine are around $8. There is a pretty good selection of food options. \n",
      "\n",
      "The improv does have a lot of great comedians who pass through! Even the opening acts are generally great! Line up early if you want a great seat right in the front! \n",
      "\n",
      "The point is, a night at the Improv will be fun, but if you aren't prepared for it, it can end up being a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair. Great night out.  I don't know if Christopher Titus set the ticket price or the club did, but at $25 a ticket, we will be going back often.  Great line up of top name acts coming to town.  extremely nice staff. highly recommend. Absolutely loved it at the Improv! I saw Sheryl Underwood and she was fantastic. It was my first time being at the Improv. After years of saying that I wanted to go, it really did meet my expectations! The ambiance is inviting, with warm lighting and a good amount of seating for a smaller place. We were 8th in line so we had good choice of seating, though we were encouraged to fill the seats in the front by the stage first. The seating is layered in tiers. Each tier has a long booth with tables and chairs for seating. It was very comfortable, roomy and an interactive set up. The stage is close to the seating (some tables are right at the stage) with little space between you and the comedian, which made it very interactive and fun. We arrived at the Improv around 9:45 pm for a show that started at 10:30 pm, with doors opening at 10:00 pm. We waited in line until the doors opened at about 10:15-10:20 pm, so they were really behind schedule. The show started around 10:45 pm with two opening comedians before the main act. The show was over around 1:00 am. The only negatives were that the staff was not very friendly and immediately told me that I have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu. ($30/ticket isn't enough?) I was not hungry and did not want to drink, so this was a bit frustrating, especially because it wasn't disclosed on the ticket or anywhere else. The server did not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and I got away getting 3 drinks for the night. The food menu looked great and the prices seemed reasonable, though if you want water you are looking at $5 for Fiji or sparkling. It was $8 for a glass of wine. $11 for bottomless soda, complete with a take home Improv glass. The other thing that I didn't like was that an employee takes your tickets while you're waiting in line and marks your hands with a dry erase marker. After one bathroom trip, the mark was gone, so I think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already paid customer since the employee takes your proof of purchase. These negatives did not affect my overall experience negatively and I would most certainly go back! It is a fun place where you are guaranteed to have a good time with a lot of laughter! So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I had\n",
      "My shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fiancés chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible, in fact, she didn't eat more than 3 pieces of it. Upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better. The Waterfront at Homestead is insane, and saves me the trip of driving all the way to Ross Park Mall. Anyway, the Giant Eagle here is enormous, as you'd imagine. It's still a standard Giant Eagle, aka the best grocery store ever. This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. They sell beer!\n",
      "2. Huuuuuge produce selection\n",
      "3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal, pasta, soups, etc and fancy chocolate bars\n",
      "4. Long isle of ethnic foods includes mexican, indian, italian, asian and , of course, jewish\n",
      "5. Functioning bakery with fresh, appetizing breads and desserts (I am still loyal to Allegro Hearth though)\n",
      "\n",
      "The store is huge and I haven't been to all of it yet but they also have nicer flowers, balloons, home/seasonal section, DVD rentals and a photo center as well as a drive-through pharmacy. \n",
      "\n",
      "It seems as this GE just might be the answer to my grocery stores woes. Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county, if not all of southwestern PA. Its selection is considerably larger than what you can find in most Giant Eagles, and it has more upscale items. I live an easy walk from the Swissvale Giant Eagle, but I often drive to this location for the superior selection. Nice Giant Eagle, not as nice as their new Market Districts, but you can look at this Giant Eagle and see how they came up with the Market District Idea and rolled with it. Fresh made sushi, good cheese selection, awesome bakery. Wahhhhh!!!! They're remodeling this one and it's frustrating! I swear I don't mind change. I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First, they switched the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct Iggle video was. That's A-ok with me, I didn't use the pharmacy anyway. \n",
      "\n",
      "But THEN, THEN they moved the whole toiletries section over there. They put my spaghetti and \"ethnic food\" section (by the way, I love that ethnic food includes spaghetti) to where my Tylenol was. My kitty food is now where my spaghetti once was. Can you tell how exasperated I'm getting?? \n",
      "\n",
      "Did I mention I don't mind change? But here's the thing, I really hate grocery shopping. It's kinda sorta my own fault because I must read every label to make sure I'm not eating something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories (even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time.) So going to this Giant Eagle frequently was nice because I KNEW WERE EVERYTHING WAS. Now I don't....wahhh! \n",
      "\n",
      "Ok, I'll stop crying. I know I'll eventually be back. I'm sure (??) it will be an even better more magical grocery shopping experience once they're done. But I can't take it for right now. I'll be forced to shop at the Ghetto Bird down in the Southside until my former #1 store is all shiny and new again. I like this Giant Eagle.\n",
      "They have the organic section and they're currently(Feb 2011) in the process of remodeling too, which is both annoying (now) and exciting (for the future).\n",
      "\n",
      "PROS:\n",
      "Always seems to be decent parking available;\n",
      "They have those cute little double-tier carts;\n",
      "Organics section;\n",
      "Wine Vending Machine (that's freaking awesome--Yay, Pennsylvania!);\n",
      "Lots of Self-Check-Out lanes;\n",
      "\n",
      "CONS:\n",
      "Sometimes the staff is a bit cranky (but that can occur anywhere, i guess); As far as GE's go, this location is great. It has basically everything you need and is well organized. You can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you can't get at other GE stores. They also offer a wine kiosk, hot bar, salad bar, and bulk olives. I would venture to say this is better than the market district. Waterfront Geagle is my primary market. Now that they've expanded and reorganized, I rarely even have to set foot in Target anymore. Yippie! There's a wine kiosk (suck it PA liquor laws), you can buy crazy expensive 6 packs, cheese market, bakery, salad and hot bar, butcher, florist, dry cleaners, international foods, pharmacy, and a little cosmetics/beauty/bath area. They usually have a sufficient number of lanes open, and it doesn't get nearly as crowded as Market District. I do wish a bulk spice selection was included as part of the expansion, but you can't always get what you want, I suppose. You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  \n",
      "\n",
      "One is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two, and thee most important part, this iggle has the best quality and well made sushi out of any Iggle's out there!  Believe me, I've eaten many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the Burgh and nothing has compared.  Dare I say, it's as close as you get to going to a good sushi restaurant.  Bold statement, right? \n",
      "\n",
      "I  just love me some sushi and want it often, quick and convenient and this serves all those purposes with upholding the quality.  Need a quick sushi fix?  This place is it! This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market, and was pleasantly surprised with the selection. I got Beemster Vlaskas, an amazing Gouda. Very large parking lot. This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  \n",
      "\n",
      "They did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for. oddly enough, of all the giant eagles i have visited in pittsburgh, this is the only location that carries the toothpaste that i've used for most of my life (outside of pittsburgh). the location is clean and the staff are friendly.  i sometimes resent having a market district being the closest giant eagle to my apartment, as many of the items that i buy there are severely overpriced. but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time, i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here, although they may not carry all the groceries that i'd like. This is a absolutely beautiful Giant Eagle.  I only stopped in to grab a quick bite from the prepared foods section, but I was rather impressed by how clean it was.  It was 9 oclock at night, and they still had a huge section of prepared foods available.  The Starbucks inside was closed, probably due to the fact it was a Sunday night, but that is another plus!\n"

      "dr goldberg offer everything i look for in a general practitioner hes nice and easy to talk to without be patronize hes always on time in see his patients hes affiliate with a topnotch hospital nyu which my parent have explain to me be very important in case something happen and you need surgery and you can get referrals to see specialists without have to see him first really what more do you need im sit here try to think of any complaints i have about him but im really draw a blank unfortunately the frustration of be dr goldbergs patient be a repeat of the experience ive have with so many other doctor in nyc good doctor terrible staff it seem that his staff simply never answer the phone it usually take 2 hours of repeat call to get an answer who have time for that or want to deal with it i have run into this problem with many other doctor and i just dont get it you have office workers you have patients with medical need why isnt anyone answer the phone its incomprehensible and not work the aggravation its with regret that i feel that i have to give dr goldberg 2 star dr goldberg have be my doctor for years and i like him ive find his office to be fairly efficient today i actually get to see the doctor a few minutes early he seem very engage with his patients and his demeanor be friendly yet authoritative im glad to have dr goldberg as my doctor be go to dr goldberg for over 10 years i think i be one of his 1st patients when he start at mhmg hes be great over the years and be really all about the big picture it be because of him not my now former gyn dr markoff that i find out i have fibroids he explore all options with you and be very patient and understand he doesnt judge and ask all the right question very thorough and want to be keep in the loop on every aspect of your medical health and your life get a letter in the mail last week that say dr goldberg be move to arizona to take a new position there in june he will be miss very much i think find a new doctor in nyc that you actually like might almost be as awful as try to find a date i dont know what dr goldberg be like before move to arizona but let me tell you stay away from this doctor and this office i be go to dr johnson before he leave and goldberg take over when johnson leave he be not a care doctor he be only interest in the copay and have you come in for medication refill every month he will not give refill and could less about patientss financial situations try to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy be a joke and to make matter even worse his office staff be incompetent 90 of the time when you call the office theyll put you through to a voice mail that no one ever answer or return your call both my adult children and husband have decide to leave this practice after experience such frustration the entire office have an attitude like they be do you a favor give me a break stay away from this doc and the practice you deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them i have never felt compel to write a bad review about anyone until i meet this pathetic excuse for a doctor who be all about the money top notch doctor in a top notch practice cant say i be surprise when i be refer to him by another doctor who i think be wonderful and because he go to one of the best medical school in the country it be really easy to get an appointment there be minimal wait to be see and his bedside manner be great dr eric goldberg be a fantastic doctor who have correctly diagnose every issue that my wife and i have have unlike many of my past doctor dr goldberg be very accessible and we have be able to schedule appointments with him and his staff very quickly we be happy to have him in the neighborhood and look forward to be his patients for many years to come im write this review to give you a head up before you see this doctor the office staff and administration be very unprofessional i leave a message with multiple people regard my bill and no one ever call me back i have to hound them to get an answer about my bill second and most important make sure your insurance be go to cover dr goldbergs visit and blood work he recommend to me that i get a physical and he know i be a student because i tell him i get the physical do later i find out my health insurance doesnt pay for preventative visit i receive an 80000 bill for the blood work i cant pay for my bill because im a student and dont have any cash flow at this current time i cant believe the doctor wouldnt give me a head up to make sure my insurance would cover work that wasnt necessary and be strictly preventative the office cant do anything to help me cover the bill in addition the office staff say the onus be on me to make sure my insurance cover visit frustrate situation i love dr goldberg best doctor ive ever have and ive have a bunch after move around a lot in the past 25 years good listener friendly straightforward always present options and take a let try the least extreme course first office staff have improve tremendously since dr johnson leave highest recommendation all the food be great here but the best thing they have be their wing their wing be simply fantastic the wet cajun be by the best most popular i also like the season salt wing wing night be monday wednesday night 075 whole wing the din area be nice very family friendly the bar be very nice be well this place be truly a yinzers dream pittsburgh dad would love this place nat we check this place out this past monday for their wing night we have hear that their wing be great and decide it be finally time to check it out their wing be whole wing and crispy which be a nice change of pace i get their wet cajun sauce and garlic butter wing the cajun do not have a bold enough flavor for me and their sauce be too thin the sauce be also thin for the garlic butter but that be more expect they be better than average but i dont like see all the sauce rest at the bottom of the boat i would definitely come try this place out again to sample some of the other items on the menu but this will probably not become a regular stop for wing anytime soon wing sauce be like water pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce frank red hot maybe the whole wing be good size and crispy but for 1 a wing the sauce could be better the hot and extra hot be about the same flavorheat the fish sandwich be good and be a large portion side be decent cold cheap beer good bar food good service look for a great pittsburgh style fish sandwich this be the place to go the bread be light fish be more than plentiful and a good side of home cut fry good grill chicken salads or steak soup of day be homemade and lot of specials great place for lunch or bar snack and beer decent range somewhat close to the city the mat be pretty solid however the grass range need to be tend too its like hit out of us open type roughnot very amenable to practice which kind of defeat the purpose of go to a golf rangestill get 3 star because the range be light up at night which be excellent for those of us who be addict to this amaze game but be somewhat short on time have a job kinda suck sometimes no own a drive range inside the city limit be like a license to print money i dont think i ask much out of a drive range decent mat clean ball and accessible hours hell you need even less people now with the advent of the machine that doles out the ball this place have none of them it be april and there be no grass tee yet btw they open for the season this week although it have be golf weather for a month the mat look like the carpet at my 107 year old aunt irenes house wear and thread bare let talk about the hours this place be equip with light yet they only sell bucket of ball until 730 it be still light out finally let you have the pit to hit into when i arrive i wasnt sure if this be a drive range or an excavation site for a mastodon or a strip mine operation there be no grass on the range just mud make it a good tool to figure out how far you actually be hit the ball oh they be cash only also bottom line this place suck the best hope be that the owner sell it to someone that actually want to make money and service golfers in pittsburgh this place be absolute garbage half of the tee be not available include all the grass tee it be cash only and they sell the last bucket at 8 despite have light and if you finish even a minute after 8 dont plan on get a drink the vend machine be sell out of course and they sell drink inside but close the drawers at 8 on the dot there be weed grow all over the place i notice some sort of bat cage but it look like those be out of order as well someone should buy this place and turn it into what it should be before i finally make it over to this range i hear the same thing from most people its just fine to go work on your swing i have such a low expectation i be pleasantly surprise its a fairly big range if you be familiar with scallys in moon it seem like it have almost as many tee though its not nearly as nice a facility the guy in the pro shop be two of the friendlier guy ive come across at range or at course yards be indeed mark and there be some target to aim for and even some hazard to aim away from a big red flag to me be the extra charge 3 to hit off the grass i be no range expert but this be the 4th one ive be to and the first ive see of that sort of nickel and dim price for the golf ball be reasonable and i do plan to be back every week until they close up in october for the season hopefully since its for sale it will reopen as a golf facility again i drive by yesterday to get a sneak peak it reopen on july 14th and i cant wait to take my kid the new range look amaze the entire range appear to be turf which may or many not help your game but it look really nice the tee box look state of the art and the club house look like something youll see on a newer course cant wait to experience it thank you rob i truly appreciate all the help i receive from this agent today who be able to remove the extra charge on my bill that the pasadena verizon store on lake be charge me on my bill for upgrade my phone when i go in i be have problems with my blacberry and have to switch to the iphone last week rob from the pennsylvania store who i be connect today be able to look at my bill and all the note and correct the problem immediately great customer service he even set up a follow up phone call with me on july 5th to make sure the credit go through on my billi cant thank him enough after wait for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program our customer service rep incorrectly process the transaction this lead to us wait another 30 minutes for him to correct it dont visit this store if you want pleasant or good service i visit this store several months ago to simply ask about smartphone plan the agent be pleasant and helpful i would recommend a visit to this store this place be delicious my parent saw a recommendation to visit this place from rick sebaks 25 things i like about pittsburgh and hes usually pretty accurate his recommendations be to try the reuben fish sandwich and openfaced steak sandwich we go early afternoon for a late lunch today a saturday and be seat right away the staff be extremely friendly my mom i each have the fish sandwich while my dad brother have a reuben sandwich the fish be very good but the reuben be to die for both dish be massive and could very easily be share between two people on top of be extremely large portion it be incredibly affordable the giant fish sandwich be 8 and the giant reuben be 750 our drink be always fill and we be check on several time during the meal we will definitely be back oh and a bite of advice ahead of time they take cash only so come prepare but im pretty sure i saw an atm there as well and i do believe they be close on sundays mondays cant miss stop for the best fish sandwich in pittsburgh this place should have a lot more review but im glad it doesnt they dont need to get any busier its be there age and look it if youre all about ambiance dont bother if you pretend youre in a movie set in pittsburgh 30 years ago it work pretty well the service be sometimes hit or miss most of girls be good one be very slow one be amaze they be all friendly and usually a few different people will check in to make sure that youre happy everything be make fresh so be prepare that nothing come fly out of that kitchen busy time it can take a good while to get food the food be awesome worth any little complaints i might think up before it get there once its on the table i forget them all fish sandwiich salmon huge and delicious flounder shrimp a few ways norfolk style be oily for my taste and i never have it grow up in norfolk hawkins st special prime rib size for two watch it the price be low the portion be large and just about everything

recommend a call for directions 4122719911 good fish sandwich after a morning of thrift store hunt a friend and i be think of lunch and he suggest emils after hed see chris sebak do a bite on it and have try it a time or two before and i have not he say they have a decent reuben but to be prepare to step back in time well see as how im kind of addict to late 40s and early 50s and the whole rat pack scene step back in time be a welcome change in da burghas long as it doesnt involve 1979 which i can see all around me every day and yet another shoot at find a decent reuben in da burghwell thats like hunt the holy grail so look under one more bush certainly wouldnt hurt so off we go right at lunchtime in the middle ofwhere exactly be we at first i think we be lose drive around a handful of very rather dismal look block in what look like a neighborhood that have be blight by the build of a highway and thenaha here it be and yep there it be this little unassuming build with an addon entrance with what look like a very old hand paint sign state quite simply emils we walk in the front door and enter another world another time and another place oh and any big burritosousa foodies might as well stop read now i wouldnt want to see you walk in roll your eye and say reaaaaaalllly this be about as old world barloungerestaurant as it get plain with a dark wood bar on one side plain white wall with no yinzer pics good sturdy chair and actual white linens on the table this be the kind of neighborhood dive that i could see frank and dino pull a few table together for some poker a fish sammich and some cheap scotch and that be exactly what i love ohbut good food count too we each have a reuben and my friend have a side of fry the reubens be decent but not ny awesome a little too thick on the bread but overall tasty and definitely fill not too skimpy on the meat i seriously crave a true good ny reuben but since i cant afford to travel right now what i find in da burgh will have to do but as we sit and eat burgers come out to an adjoin table those be some big thick burgers a steak go past for the table behind us that be huge and when we ask about it the waitress say yeah its huge and really good and he only charge 1299 for it aint that nut another table of five come in and wham fish sandwich pile with bread fish that look amaze yeah i want that that that and that my friend also mention that they have a chicken parm special one day of the week that be only serve until 4 pm and that it be fantastic if only i could get there on that week day before 4 the waitress do a good job especially since there be quite a grow crowd at lunchtime on a saturday and only one of her she keep up and be very friendly they only have pepsi products so i have a brew ice tea which be very fresh and she do pop by to ask about refill as often as she could as the lunch hour go on they be get busy emils be no frills good portion very reasonable price very comfortable neighborhood hole in the wallkind of like cheer but in a blue collar neighborhood in the 1950s fanfreakintastic i could feel at home here you definitely want to hit mapquest or plug in your gps though i be not sure that i could find it again on my ownit really be a hide gem i will be make my friend take me back until i can memorize where the heck it be addendum 2nd visit for the fish sandwich excellent truly a pound of fish on a fishshaped bun as oppose to da burghs seemingly popular hamburger bun the fish be flavorful the batter excellent and for just 8 this may have be the best fish sandwich ive yet to have in da burgh this be a hide gem no really it take us forever to find but well worth it it be right across the street from the rankin police station the menu have a wide selection i really couldnt decide what i want but i go with the ribeye sandwich im glad i do too huge sandwich i add mushroom it be very flavorful my boyfriend get the fish sandwich he enjoy it as well fast and friendly service will definitely be back this would be my local haunt if i be ever to relocate to the pittsburgh area what a great little place such friendly staff and some damn good eat it be so great that we actually go there twice during our 4day vacation to catch the steelersravens game they have daily sandwich specials on thursday night we go and have the special roast beef and cheese sand and the 35 cent wing very very tasty im sorry but this place kick primanti bros butt on the taste factor they have about 8 different type of wing reg garlic and i cant remember the rest we get the regular and i be wish we would have order more go back on a friday night we order the buffalo chicken pizza and a pepperoni n mushroom wow that buffalo chicken pizza be awesome the other thing that stick out for me be one of the customers an older gentleman he seem to be a regular i really really want his spam tshirt a great townie bar with tasty food and an interest clientele i go to check this place out on the way home from the airport one friday night and it didnt disappoint it be refresh to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stop and everyone in the place be star at you im guess the mix crowd of older hockey fan young men in collar shirt and thirtysomethings have probably see it all during their time at this place the staff be top notch the order be somewhat overwhelm as they appear shortstaffed for the night but my waitress try to keep a positive attitude for my entire visit the other waiter be wear a hood cardigan and i want to steal it from him due to my difficulty in find such a quality article of clothe we order a white pizza large in size engulf in cheese full of garlic flavor flavorful hot sausage an overall delicious pizza aside from 2 things 1 way too much grease i know this come with the territory but still it be sometimes unbearable 2 can mushroom the worst thing to come out of a can ever i would rather eat can alpo than can mushroom and if the mushroom werent can they be just the worst mushroom ive ever consume the mushroom debacle be enough to lower the review by an entire star disgust my advice for the place be keep everything awesome random music from the jukebox tasty food great price good crowd and staff and get some decent mushroom why they spoil an otherwise above average pie with such inferior crap ill never know alexions have be around forever the first time i go in there i be 19 years old on summer break from college and work at the ice cream factory up the hill all of the union guy from the ice cream factory go in there after work and i immediately find out why many many years later i stop in there with some fond memories and once again felt welcome and value as a customer even though they didnt know who i be the sandwich be do pittsburghstyle sort of like primantis and they be as perfect today as they be back in ancient time when i first start visit the place alexions be a clean and peaceful little place in the rook station part of green tree the oldest part of the town i recall that some of the sandwich i get there be order at a pretty late hour nothing but good things to say about the place and i wish it be closer to home good for cheap drink and wing they offer daily specials which be nice doesnt look like much from outside but the inside be friendly enough the bartenders have be there for awhile and do a good job dont expect to have a huge selection of alcohol their wing be good as be their salads if you be gluten free this be not your placelots of fry food and sandwich offer a quick lunch what a cool barrestaurant i will no doubt be visit again the service and price be great and the restrooms be clean i have the buffalo chicken sandwich and it be delicious the menu consist of typical bar food food however theres a few different items on there which stand out on the menu a cool bar off the beat path that be a worth a trip cheer awesome drink specials during happy hour fantastic wing that be crispy and delicious wing night on tuesday and thursday good beer selection understaffed for a light monday night crowd it wasnt her fault she be the only server but it take about an hour to get our sandwich mine be one of the best reubens ive ever have grow up near here the family would always go once a month havent stop in for a few years until last friday with a few friends to grab a drink the sandwich be always amaze just as i remember the staff be amaze and friendly great place for lunch as well very disappoint in the customer service we order reubens and want coleslaw instead of kraut they charge us 300 for the coleslaw we will not be back the ice tea be also terrible taste let there be no question alexions own the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades try a burger on italian bread the service be flawlessly friendly the food be amaze and the wing oh the wing but its still about the cheeseburger the atmosphere be invite but you cant eat atmosphere so go right now grab the car key you know youre hungry for an amaze cheeseburger maybe some wing and a cold beer easily hand down the best bar and grill in pittsburgh the sandwich the wing enough say alexions can best be describe as a homestyle primantis before they go mega commercial you really cant go wrong but for my money i would put alexions fish sandwich up with the best ive have thats not to take away from other selections but if you come here i recommend not leave until youve have either the fish sandwich reuben or wing youll know youre in a pittsburgh bar when you walk in for someone who live in atlanta now and only make it to pittsburgh a few time a year i have to say it be refresh feel like home i havent have a trip back without make it out to alexions at least once we meet a couple of friends there on a friday afternoon about 440 pm base on the yelp review ive rely on yelp in over a dozen different cities never come away with anything less than a positive experience until today we order within 5 minutes of sit down there couldnt have be more than 20 people in the place count the people on the patio take them almost 40 minutes to serve 3 sandwich and a salad i try the fish sandwich come out fry extra crispy on the end if there be such a thing as fish jerky a third of the sandwich would have qualify it be just ok ive have better at almost any church that fry fish during lend all 3 of my dinner companion leave partial sandwich or salad uneaten bread french fry and onion ring be good though ice tea be good though ive never see a place dispense sweet n low like they be give away their last rock of crack ask for sugar but never saw any they dont carry any other artificial sweeteners besides the pink stuff i may give the place another try in the future for a reuben or hamburger assume today be some aberration possibly due to a cook have a family emergency or something like that waitress be pretty good hold up under my multiple request to find out if they catch my fish yet hardly ever roll her eye use to go there for tire brake etc their price have go way up400 for 4 midlevel tire for a toyota plus 1 of the new tire go flat within 3 weeks since they dont make appointments the wait to get the tire look at be 2 hours sorrycant wait that long to get a warrant repair they lose my business for good i get new tire from them and within two weeks get a flat i take my car to a local mechanic to see if i could get the hole patch but they say the reason i have a flat be because the previous patch have blow wait what i just get the tire and never need to have it patch this be suppose to be a new tire i take the tire over to flynns and they tell me that someone puncture my tire then try to patch it so there be resentful tire slashers i find that very unlikely after argue with the guy and tell him that his logic be far fetch he say hed give me a new tire this time i will never go back to flynns bc of the way this guy treat me and the simple fact that they give me a use tire terrible preordered my tire and when i arrive they couldnt find the order anywhere once we get through that process i wait over 2 hours for them to be put on i be originally tell it would take 30 mins slow over price ill go elsewhere next time contrary to other review i have zero complaints about the service or the price i have be get tire service here for the past 5 years now and compare to my experience with place like pep boys these guy be experience and know what theyre do also this be one place that i do not feel like i be be take advantage of just because of my gender other auto mechanics have be notorious for capitalize on my ignorance of cars and have suck my bank account dry but here my service and road coverage have all be well explain and let up to me to decide and they just renovate the wait room it look a lot better than it do in previous years last summer i have an appointment to get new tire and have to wait a super long time i also go in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on they fix it for free and the very next morning i have the same issue i call to complain and the manager didnt even apologize so frustrate never go back they seem overprice too most random location for a mini golf course ever this be old school its build into the woods spray yourself for bug first right off forsythe rd near carnegie park the candy hut be fun to spend your spare change they recently recarpeted the hole and add a few gimmicks that werent there before it wont knock your sock off but if youre local give it a try this quaint mini golf course be one of the oldest yet most original and fun locations that i have yet visit come from texas it be nice to see a course locate amongst the hilly and woody pennsylvanian terrain it can be frustrate that it be literally impossible to make a holeinone on most every hole and that the course also make it extremely difficult to predict the direction on how the ball will follow through and bounce the cartoonlike outrageousness of the course prove to give laugh and a fun attempt to play improvements be be make and i will look forward to return on my next visit to the pittsburgh area i enjoy travel and visit new course and the only reason why i didnt give this location 5 star be because it be impossible to intuitively shoot the ball for a best effort to beat par i think this place be close their number be out of service sign be go and the course have not be maintain awesome woodsy mess of a course though ive be inform by a fellow yelper that they be just close for the season i hope theyre right i find it strange they dont keep their phone number in service with a record and that they didnt cover the course up to protect it from weather vandalism etc either way i cant wait to get my game on in the spring dont waste your time we have two different people come to our house to give us estimate for a deck one of them the owner both time we never hear from them not a call not the estimate nothing i will start by say we have a nice new deck that be where the good part end why two star if we have a nice deck now well it all start in may when we have a man name al come out and talk to us about the process he be a true salesman ill tell you that not a straight shooter but an excite salesman that want to sell and we buy into it he tell us they be back up with the harsh winter and a lot of job but they could probably start by june 24th mind you this be the end of may we meet with him he say they would have to do a survey of our land and get a permit from dormont before they start we felt confident in go with them and book it heres where things fell apart weeks go by with no word from them on the process finally i call and leave message al finally get in touch with me and the conversation be utterly confuse he must have not understand me because he just keep talk in circle so i hang up not know what be go on finally i call back and the admin tell me that the survey could take a couple weeks to come back i wish al would have tell us that so our june 24th date come and go we finally get our survey and they be quick to bill us for it but no word on where we be in the process i call back a couple time with no real answer from the admin apparently they be now wait for the permit from dormont a month later i be frustrate and ask to speak with someone at the company i speak with someone who tell me that dormont usually take a week to process the permit but we be now go on a month he tell me he would bug the guy about it and we finally get it i completely understand that wait on the permit be not their fault but why no communication about it just call me and tell me theyre wait for the permit but theyll work towards ask dormont what the hold up be seem simple finally we get the permit and work be suppose to start tuesday come and they have to wait for approval from dormont on hole theyre dig so hole be dig and equipment be put in my backyard and then nothing happen for two days where do everyone go who know because i wasnt inform i be upset and contact the company owner dave by email i tell him how frustrate i be about the lack of communication he write me two sentence that say there will be acres there tomorrow morning to finish and most will be do tomorrow well that didnt happen then two other dudes show up two days later and do work for about three hours and leave the main guy come back the next day and say they do it wrong so apparently the part about how they wouldnt need access to my house change to theyre drill bolt into my house to secure he deck finally the second week into construction my tiny 10x11 foot deck be do it be upset that they leave the deck dirty and all the dirt and cement they move around wasnt clean up i even ask them to fill all the hole they dig up and didnt use and they only fill up one when you create a construction project isnt it just good business to clean it up and make it look nice didnt happen here my main point be contractors have a reputation for not be the most trustworthy why be that company why not be an upstanding company that consumers can trust my main issue with them be that things be not communicate to me properly up front nor be the ongoing process communicate to me then they leave everything unfinished in my eye leave the site dirty i understand things happen and things get delay but just email or call me its not that hard to keep me update it be 2014 with a million ways to be contact even though i have a nice deck after i clean things up myself i would not recommend them to anyone when i want a deck for the back of my home i end up call quaker state construction it end up work very well and they be very polite i get an estimate and call them to start work out the detail of my new deck once we get the plan all sort out they start build my new deck and it be finish with in a reasonable amount of time i now have a beautiful deck that i can relax and that my family can enjoy overall they do a good job and i would use them in the future for all my deck necessities i have never see a restaurant that have a frown brownie aka frownie as their icon mascot or spokesperson kings family restaurant have surprise me with this i think it might be in direct dialogue with eat n park smile cookie funny funny odd not funny haha we be seat rather quickly by the manager very nice people work here i be happy to find that even though they have close a section the server be will to stay longer to serve us our dinner we chat with the server a little bite she be quite engage and then move on to order our meal tea pepsi openfaced hot turkey sandwich with mash potatoes and gravy buffalo chicken strip with mash potatoes and macaroni n cheese our drink arrive and our server converse with us some more about the area she would leave every couple of minutes to check on our food and to make certain that her other table have everything they need eventually our entrees arrive both pip hot i go straight for the macaroni and cheese it didnt taste bad but i swear that it be make by stouffers i didnt feel the need to eat that much know that there be other things to eat i try the mash potatoes and find that they too come from a package but again they didnt taste bad with the brown gravy i move on to the main part of my meal the buffalo chicken strip at least they be all white meat and the buffalo sauce be more than just mild i content myself with eat them i try some of the hot turkey sandwich and just leave the rest for my friend since it be not fresh cut turkey but instead luncheon meat that have be heat i finish off my dinner and be happy in the end no it wasnt the best food in the world but the service greatly help the perception and it didnt taste bad so back in the late 90s there use to be this superkickass cinnamon ice cream like an apple pie ice cream without the apples or the pie crust so delicious however now there be some shittastic replacement that taste like vanilla ice cream with last years redhot in the middle totally gross fortunately our server be nice enough to warn me about the change and bring me a sample so i only have to suffer the death of a childhood memory rather than also have to pay for it the portion be big and fill just dont come for the ice cream ive pretty much be eat at various kings pretty regularly since i be a child when my parent would take my sister and i into the fox chapel location often lately me and my girl have be visit the heidelburg location i love the food it really taste homemade much like something a grandmother would make complete with gobs of butter and side dish price be low selection be great but dont expect fine din by any mean service be hit or miss at pretty much all of them if you have lunch at any kings you will likely be wait on by a sweet but sarcastic older lady who have be do the wait thing for 30 years and know her game seek out this lady my experience with the younger crowd at night isnt the same im in my 30s now and very little have change other than the fox chapel location be remodel about 10 years ago to look less like a diner which be a big fail any girl i meet have to enjoy kings or shes out hoofah i heart kings ive always be a fan and this one be as good as my old one in monaca i arrive around 10 be on a saturday morning i be greet by the hostesswho be polite and friendly and i inform her that i be alone she have just arrive as well and wasnt exactly sure what be go on yet so she ask the manager where she should seat me after receive guidance she bring me to a table towards the back it have not yet be clean after the previous guests have din so she quickly get it clear off grab a rag and wipe it down the waitress come rather quickly to take my drink order she be extremely friendly i order coffee and water which she go and get while i look over the menu she return and take my order i order the cinnamon swirl french toast special three slice of french toast make with pittsburghs own jenny lee® cinnamon swirl two farmfresh egg with bacon or sausage i choose sausage and your

want them the cheesy hash brown casserole and the french toast be both delicious i also enjoy the sausage which be pretty typical kings family restaurant feature a very friendly staff great price and tasty food i be please and will definitely come back again thisis not the closest kings to us but we often will travel the extra miles because the service and food at this location be always the best average run of the mill store associate be young teens and they really dont know where anything be luckily i be able to get around to find everything find my puppy treat and move on not bad for a shop n save most be privately own so availability of items might differ from place to place the only time i frequent s n s be when the have their huge two day sales usually hold on thursday and friday at least once month good bakery at this location too two meals on the recommendation of a friend who live near the place and after the second trip i be compel to write rocky would definitely describe the experience on the first trip i go to try their at that timeraved about reuben and yet to find a true good reuben in da burgh i try it well they be out of the proper bread and the guy have to run to the store to buy the closest thing he could find which be not the proper bread and instead of one of their rave about reubens i receive two minireubens which basically take the gut from one reuben and spread it out onto two sandwich on regular size bread i eat it it wasnt great but they swear it be because theyd run out of the bread bread or not it still wasnt great the atmosphere be pleasant in that blue collar bar kind of way and the staff be very nice but not a win pitch on the reuben the second trip be after a long day of move furniture with the same friend sit in the back room instead of the bar which felt more like a restaurant of course with the big screen tv cover the sport of the moment i be in the mood for dinner this time and after a scan decide on fry chicken and mash potatoes with the salad bar my friend order one of her faves the bread pork chop we hit the salad bar which be uberbasic three soup mostly vegetable load which leave me out basic iceberg lettuce mix very probably out of a bag a few veggie toppings and three or four dress it be a basic salad no big deal more or less an appetizer filler before the meal the mindblower in this trip be the order of the fry chicken dinner our waiter look like a 19 year old gas station attendant skinny little blonde guy with a sweet but incredibly naive face and an air of vapidity which be confirm when i place my order i ask what chicken piece come in the dinner and ask if it be possible to only get dark meat i never imagine how confuse a question that could possibly be it literally take him two trip back to the kitchen to ask and the child honestly have no clue what white meat and dark meat mean the first answer he come back with be that the chicken come in a preportioned prepare bag kind of kentucky fry chicken stylewhich didnt answer my question thus prompt the second trip after the second trip back i hear the cook holler tell him ill fix him up well the chicken be prepackaged dreck like youd find in the freezer case of walmart tiny and not good and the potatoes have that slight tinge of chemspuds flavor lade with some kind of chop up green parsley and a side of that basic brown gravy serve up in 5 gallon bucket thank goodness for the basic salad bar even my friend admit that her pork chop be different and not what shed expect they also appear to be from a freezer bag the irony be that the boy who didnt know white meat from dark meat be chat with some other customersabout baseballand he be a genius about the mindless sport of baseball ahhhh da burgh third base nahwhy bother when there be so many other options around go on in a grab a beer and chat black and gold if you happen to be in carnegiethey can help you out all type of ways in that area just dont go hungry if you actually

goodness thank to the wellseasoned griddle where all of the food be make here be the highlight cheap breakfast for two can be well under 10 with lunch around the same crowd get there early and expect to wait they close pretty early on the weekend too oddly at 1245pm cash only huge portion when order fry or homefries always get the half order unless youre a lumberjack about those homefries theyre

especially with their homemade sausage i also like the mix grill my parent love their burgers take off a star for lumpy booths and really tight table your arm get hit when someone walk past oh and waitress arent very attentive if youre look for no frills but a great breakfast this be the place i get the mix grill half portion and be very full make sure you have extra calories for the day because they be not afraid to use butter love the breakfast and would go back not much room for sit down but worth the wait great homemade hot breakfast sausage and a wonderful family restaurant feel remind me of the one my parent use to own in mi have fun find a table on the weekend great breakfast place come hungry look for dick my dad and gino at the counter every be about 0830 and say hi try the mix grill half ok what be with all of these cash only place in pittsburgh i can appreciate that some smaller businesses might have trouble instal a credit card system in their storeresturant but could you perhaps provide an atm in the past this would deter me from eat at this place look at a standard breakfast menu i decide to go with a tuna melt instead what i get be a cold tuna salad sandwich with a slice of cheese on toast i have order a melt be in the mood for a warm meal but to no avail one day later i cant even remember what my side be i suppose it didnt leave much of an impression on me i have to say that the dessert be really good the cherry pecan pie i have not see this concoction anywhere else but this be awesome the cherries be not the sweet can variety but a pie worthy tart top with sugar i think i want to make this pie with my parent next harvest of our cherry tree my first impression be eh i be learn how crazy pittsburghers be over breakfast seriously wait 30 minutes for a table at a tiny diner with a menu that read as follow 2 egg and toast xxx 2 egg meat and toast xxx 2 egg and pancake xxx id rather go to a dennys and order the create your own grand slam best diner in the counrty weve be to many famous diners across the country and we still give gab and eat the best rat i be a little intimidate when i first walk in and there be like 2 pound of butter just sit on top of the homefires on the grill if you be look for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you but everything i eat be clearly the opposite of healthy after try like every meal they have i would recommend the mix grillhalf unless you be share add cajun season with the texas toast burgers be great too its hard to find a place that make a better breakfast than you could make by yourself at home but this place do it the atmosphere be classy old school americana best french toast ever love the friendly atmosphere and especially the breakfast never be disappoint

wait staff be quick and efficient as well as helpful and friendly with our larger group of 9 people the fact that none of the plat match and i notice a sign at the front register that say we need mug just make me love this place even more a few tip 1 order the mix grill 2 cash only 3 gab and eat be a popular place but also very small and narrow or cozy if you will i recommend go during the week when they be still busy but can accomodate a group that way you wont feel rush or crowd 4 get to gab and eat asap youll be glad you do classic breakfast joint grimy look hole in the wall locate on one end of a seedy look strip mall window be opaque due to the grease so you cant hardly see inside on the outside there be about a dozen people wait to get in when you finally do get inside you see that

definitely go back after i buy some new stretchy pant best breakfast spot in the area if you like diner food it be the place to go small so you will want to avoid the church crowd on sundays but the wait be never too long everyone be friendly and have obviously be work there for a while if you be feel like lunch food go a little later their burgers be make on the breakfast griddle and be

inexpensive large portion work class breakfast plat on our current road trip of baseball brew hockey and diners we decide to try gab eat base on yelpers rat put it 1 for breakfast in pittsburgh area we have to agree with most other reviewers that this be a place to eat we arrive around noon on saturday and be happy there be a couple open table the place be tuck at the end of a strip mall and you have to look to find it there be plenty of park inside the decor be quaint and funky at the same time country style decorations and sign be mix with nostalgia sign posters most interest be all the signatures and comment write on the wall by past customers we regret not have a marker to add ours the other highlight be three large white board with trivia question fun way to spend time wait for food the waitstaff there isuh experience they be attentive pleasant and efficient after read review i have to try the mix grill but s go with pancakes with a side of bacon the pancakes be outstandingmaybe the best either of us have eat they be thick but with light texture and rich flavor his bacon be cook just as request as crisp as possible and very flavorful the mix grill be a mix together concoction of egg potatoes onions pepper cheese and spicy italian sausage grill together im glad i heed those who stress go with the half size order it fill a full size dinner plate with a heap order i couldnt finish it all and thats rare how do they serve the whole potion in a trough everything be cook well the sausage add a nice bite to offset the somewhat plain potatoes you can build your own mix but the basic be a good mix my only complaint be the amount of potato and that they be pretty plain i like home fry with lot of season that have age on the grill these potatoes be pretty uniform chunk with little season personal preference it usually come with italian toast but they be out so i go with raisin it be delicious soft inch thick slice coffee be excellent and the cup stay full the total be less than 15 fabulous value for the quality and portion while i cant say its the best breakfast in pittsburgh only here 3 days its the best so far and one of the best weve have meet my nephew for lunch in carnegie and he suggest gab eat way to go justin the restaurant be in a strip mall across from the dairy queen the grill be right up front so you can see them cook they have counter space for eat and tablesbooths for 4 dont expect to sit at one table if you have more than 4 they have a great look breakfast menu we all get burgers of vary kinds they be tasty the buns be butter toast and soft yum the amount of butter didnt bother me but it do my whiny mother who whine even though there be a no whine sign as you walk in the door we order fresh cut fry as onion ring both of which be great the half order be plenty and a nice option to a full order the restaurant be full of local men at lunch which be usually a good sign i give it a 4 star only because of the waitress who kind of throw straw silverware and napkins at us as she walk behind the counter at least she didnt throw the food when it come she also serve the fry and onion ring way before our burgers come out which be kind of weird they be nice and hot but would have be cold have we wait for the burgers it didnt factor into my four star rat but i deduct a star from nephew because he invite us out to lunch then allow me pay just kid justin love ya this be a perfect example of what a breakfast diner can be excellent breakfast in huge portion for cheap i have the western omlet and will be get it or another omlet again soon the coffee be good totally serviceable diner coffee the waitress be wonderfully friendly and hop around from table to table the food be excellent the ambience be exactly right for a diner it be pack the wait be not nearly as long as i be expect 10 minutes maybe totally recommend come hungry wow read the great review and i be not let down huge portion the mix grill be the best breakfast ive ever have if you go to pittsburgh it be a must eat service be superb friendly staff lead zeppelin on the wall what else could you ask for i have be come to gab n eat for almost 20 years and they have never let me down i get a typical breakfast if egg ham toast and home fry delicious as usual the ambience however be usually lack the wall be dark with write and signatures of semi famous people all over the place picture of local people hang on the wallsi secretly want mine up there along with posters galore while its fun to look at the first 10 time it get a little bore after awhile so today when i arrive i expect the same old experience wow be i wrong as soon as i look at the door i know something be different the place seem lighter and brighter to my pleasant surprise they paint and get new counter top theyre not quite do yet but the place have a new happy vibe to it the awesome breakfast the new decor and the 5 guy sit at the counter make me laugh be why i will be back maybe for lunch a gem the coffee cup be mismatch the owner be three feet away from me cook the sausage be make for them locally and the food be frickin awesome i have the pancakes my daughter have the sausage and egg sandwich cash only friendly service excellent breakfast and lunch menu friendly staff and super food modest environment with excellent food worth the wait dont miss this one best breakfast and lunch food in the pgh south hill hand down what a find i stop in here for breakfast while in town for business the service be so friendly i think i be down south the service be quick frankly and felt like i be with family fantastic poach egg cajun homefries and crispy bacon gab and eat be definitely a place i world recommend to locals i be stuff and the bill be only 800 a fine breakfast joint you gotta love the small diners highly recommend barb country junction get a 5 star rat for me because it be truly everything that a pittsburgh restaurant should be in addition to be the apple of my nostalgias eye it be also the constant think of my tummy when im hungry on the weekend barb breakfast cannot be beat but truly any meal you get there you wont regret everything be make to order with fair portion and great price my recommendation be a breakfast sandwich on a bagel and a coffee theres nothing better than drink from a cup that could have come from your grandmas kitchen i know that gab n eat be nearby and barb can be a little weird get to with the strange traffic pattern but this really be a gem of carnegie that youve gotta try great little place treat you like a localeaten here 3 time a week for a month same overtime barb be always here this be a great place to eat and everyone be so friendly i live right down the street from here but unfortunately i have only go a once trust me i will go here more often the food be great price be low and the staff be friendly my cousin and i want a place to eat and catch up and this be perfect place i will go here more often my first time go to barb country junction and i really want to like this place i really didhowever i didnt the food be decent some be above average and some below but it be overall decent i get pancakes bacon and egg the pancakes be really good and fluffy the home fry be simply okay and the egg be not cook well my son have a burger and it be good the coffee at this place be brew to perfection which a appreciate i would give the food 35 the service be subpar for sure while our waitress be a really nice girl she wasnt on top of anything at all have to ask for coffee refill have to ask for silverware for napkinsetc she get the order mess up and so on i give the service 25 the inside of the place have some country charm as youd expect but want particularly cleanly it also have a leaky roof in several place which have bucket collect the water a customer even trip over the bucket and fell i give the interior 25 the price be decent i feed my whole family breakfast 3 of us for 23 i give the price 35 so in summary you can get okay food here for a rather cheap price but it be not a great place to dine in by any mean there be better diners in the area that i will patronize in the future rather than barb my husband and i try this place for the first time today it be easy to find and no problems with park its seat yourself but there be no sign state this so we stand there look like fool for a minute it take awhile for the waitress to acknowledge us and im guess that this be barb she apologize and say that one of her workers call off today no big deal and her apology be appreciate she come back with our drink drop them off and leave again we didnt see her for another 20 minutes ultimately we be there for 30 minutes before she take our order this be aggravate to me i dont mind wait for my food if i know its go to be awesome and theyre make it with love but come on now we order the hot pepper omelettehome fry toast and chocolate chip pancakessausage the food be alright really nothing special a new waitress end up take care of us and she be much more attentive we may or may not go back for the price i end up pay this place be fine there be a full kitchen king bed and tv i be just surprise at the lack of amenities at the hotel while i have stay at other extend stay hotels i be surprise to find a sign in the room at this one state that you only get your room clean once per weekif you want it more often than that you would have to pay for it if you need fresh towel youd have to go to the main desk to get them they also only provide a small bar of soap in the roomnot the typical soap shampoo lotion etc this didnt bother me too much as i be only stay a couple days but again i find it surprise not to have these basic things the hotel in general be easy to get to and very easy to get back onto to freeway from the hotel be clean and the people who work there be very nice great value close drive to city not much to do around hotel its a business park carnegie city have a few bar and restaurants simple rustic local wait that be every gordon ramsey review my experience at extend stay america be great the staff be warm and friendly and make it a point to speak to me every morning as i leave and when i return in the even they go out of their way to provide a confirmation and point me in the direction of restaurants and nightspots when need if i ever need to utilize an extend stay hotel i wouldnt hesitate to head back there ive stay at a couple of extend stay sit that i find quite satisfactory and this location prove to be just as good excellent place to stay while visit pittsburgh it be just a five minute drive to downtown location be in a business park area so it be quiet the room contain a nice kitchenette area with a full size refrigerator sink cabinets and two burners there be no oven which i expect as the descriptions all state full kitchen so be aware of that also they do not keep the dish pot and pan coffee makers toasters or utensils in the room if you want them you have to request them at the desk during check in the room be clean and well maintain cable tv quality be spotty sometimes but not intolerable the free wifi be usually fast the best part about this location be the staff the people at the desk be all very pleasant and welcome and quite will to assist with any question or issue with a smile i would definitely stay at this location again and highly recommend it tonya be super sweet and the front desk people be very helpful i have say it on other sit and will repeat here you must try their burgers they be juicy and delicious with a bun that be perfect another must be the fry with guinness gravy and if you havent have enough go for the ultimate sleeper leek and potato soup authentic black tan harp and murphys on tap it dont get no better this be a true gem my friends be warn dont expect the best service ever its not the cleanest place youve be in either the decor be soccer jerseys from place and team youve probably never hear of its divey eclectic and authentic if youre look for good irish food and a cold pint you cant go wrong at the pour house like most of carnegies main st this be a hide gem worth seek out they have some of the best irish food ive have in pittsburgh the colcannon be awesome and the shepherd pie be out of this world if youre not look for irish food then try the grill cheese and make sure you ask it with the three cheese together its big and the cheese be thick and gooey i get it with a side of potato pancakes yum also they have guinness smithwicks and harp on tap if i could give this place less than one star i would i have no idea who give this place high review but they must either own the place or be time travelers from back in the day when this place might not have suck the decor be tire and grimy the place reek of smoke and the bartenderserver be surly to put it mildly we go there on a saturday night with a mind to try the irish food apparently we be out of luck ive always think that the secrets of restaurant success be to actually stock food for people to eat he tell us before we order that they have no pies no chicken pot pie no shepherd pie etc so we gamely try to order other things we place our order my wife for example order the irish stew and he come back 5 min later tell us they be out of that and even more things for several people in our party at that point my wife pick out a third option ham and cabbage only to be tell again that they be out at that point realize that the only food to be have in the place be what be crust on the menus we ask to pay for our drink and leave they actually then give us flack for not have enough to put it on a debit card in short unless you like your dinner with a side of disappointment and depression id probably avoid this place like the plague speak of the plague i suppose we should thank mr surly for inspire us to walk out i only have two bathrooms at my house and wouldve be hard press to accommodate several violently ill people at once best irish food in the burgh great bar food too the service be maybe a bite surly and its not the cleanest nor the best decor but thats not what this place be about its a town irish bar and it serve great solid irish fare and suds to the locals and it do it better than anyone i go back again and again okay so hopefully you havent be enjoy happy hour rileys pour house before you read this or you might not be able to follow the lilt irish owners to recap murphys pour house from 19791985 sullivans pour house from 19952002 paddys pour house from 20022012 and bagpipe please rileys pour house open march 1 of 2012 still with me its a tiny long bar just like the old irish pubs no more smoke allow hurrah same lousy service my guess be that the entire place need no strike that demand an automate foodbeverage ticket system none of the cook bartenders or waitress know who order what nor what ticket belong to which table its actually pretty funny if youre not a hungry or b thirsty i really really want this place to do better we need more irish pubs and local old time water hole get it together murphys er i mean sullivanser i mean paddys or be it rileys whatever the case they have cold guinness and irish music and fun patrons the delivery driver mistakenly ring my doorbell have confuse 133 and 113 rather than take a step back and analyze the situation he begin to accuse my wife and i of order and refuse to pay for this pizza the driver then get on his cell phone and rather than call the number than be give when the order be place begin to call his boss and start threaten me with felony charge so i take the initiative and ask the fine upstanding gentleman what the phone number of the orderer be phone my neighbor and discover the mistake rather than a thank you or a sorry he just speed off break the speed limit on our block to reach his destination 50 feet away i would call to complain but base on the other review its clear the owners do not care about carnegie or its residents and its pretty well know around town just how awful their food be so it would be pointless to boycott a place id never order from again anyway do yourself a favor and order from any other establishment in town 3612 visit i be from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco this place be dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every taste come from a dive the food be really good and my group order a bunch of different things it be all good a taste price be reasonable a they dont speak english very good and get my order wrong sweet potatoe fry a pizza a eggplant hoagie b greek salad b gyro a if they scrub the place down and the lady speak better english 4 star recommend 16 inch pizza on special be cheap fast service not the best pizza but above average some of the worst pizza ive ever have we use a coupon from the paper for a 2 top 8 cut sicilian first of all the pizza wasnt even cut through and the sad attempt at cut be so uneven that 4 of the slice be about an inch wide while the others be about 4 each the toppings be scarce they use mini pepperoni and put maybe 8 on the whole pizza the onions be huge chunk and the mushroom be straight from a can the worst part though be the thick doughy crust that taste more like a fishy sourdough roll im serious it be so noticeable that it make me wonder if the dough be bad or if they for some weird reason put fish sauce in it it be gross we also order steak and italian hoagies the veggies be old and wilt and there be no dress on either the italian have deli meat that be clearly bottom of the line and not very generous the steak if you an call it that be greyish instead of brown and look like it be a process meat chop into piece no flavor or season and the texture be reminiscent of spam it be so bad that i only eat 14 of it and toss the rest i have order from here in the past and always be disappoint i think i would give them another try since id never order a sicilian pizza from there what a mistake i will never order from them again have certain businesses with skill set in your local neighborhood be important i try to keep it as local as possible so when i hear about a tailor in carnegie i be intrigue the build be in a strip mall across from carnegie coffee company unassuming look like it be close all the time until you do a drive by and see the hours post there be a latino man in his 20s work when you arrive in my mind i imagine a tailor to be older kind of like my grandfather maybe with measure tape around his neck textbook movie tailor so i be a bite trepidatious about drop off my clothe he ask you to go change into a closet yes a closet to change in with one lightbulb but all my worry aside the moment he start work on my items i know he be the real deal he learn from his father at the age of 14 how to sew and he do things the correct way mean for example i take in a pair of khakis all the way down to the cuff but he seam them up to look exactly the way they be when i first buy them most place will have bulge and pucker the rest of my items be just as perfect very inexpensive at 10 for a pair of pant to adjust the hem the items be do in a timely manner he take his business very seriously while i be there i watch a lady rush in and demand 6 shirt to be alter in an hour and he do it and charge the same price really nice guy please go and support this business to keep him around town new to area and decide to pay this shop a visit it be definitely the best experience ive ever have with a tailor he be much cheaper than the other shop he charge 10 while others charge 15 and he go above and beyond for what he charge i drop off 4 jeans and he hem and taper the jeans i couldnt even tell the difference between the store buy jeans and the quality of his work it be absolutely perfect no bulge or pucker they the match the exact stitch as the factory absolutely a great guy they be all do and wait for me as promise ill definitely be take all of my business to this place and would highly recommend to anyone

highly recommend if you need any do be you be really look at the review for ljs its fry stuff with extra fry stuff in a cardboard boat you will regret eat it 30 minutes after you finish but it be delicious i agree with paul on this one but i have to stop here on my way home from work tonight i think i feel my heart yell at me again the gal at the drive thru window be just soooo sweet i just might go back and ask her to marry me but then again she give me a slip with a survey on it to fill out online maybe she just want my positive response ok sarah b you get it now wheres my free coke its deep fry garbageits los cmon what do you expecthowever i have never have better friendlier service at a fast food restaurant by far the worst most unprofessional dentist i have ever experience her staff be too busy watch soap operas on all the tvs in each room instead of clean and she give me a fill which be too deep which could have be understandable as her son have his picture deliver from hawaii and she have to stop 3 time to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen i have to have oral surgery and have the tooth remove because she put the fill in too deep an abscessed tooth be the result i wouldnt recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone i hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain i have to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after i call and ask them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and do not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribe me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pull when i move to the area dr weinberg be recommend to me by my cousin who have be a client for years ive have nothing but positive experience with her and her staff since see her two years ago the team be professional nice and courteous i recently have to reschedule an appointment due to a last minute work thing and they be very accommodate my daughter look forward to come to the dentist so thats say something i do wish they would turn off fox news in the lobby as id rather watch paint dry but nobodys perfect in all fairness i do not see this dentist but do schedule an appointment and wait 15 minutes for them to open when i look at yelp review i usually weed out the outliers the best and the worst unfortunately there be only two review it be my first time at the office the office admin very nice ask for me to come early before 9am to complete paperwork i arrive at 850 i wait i watch 2 employees walk by me unlock the door and relocked it they do not acknowledge me the door i be at have signage open hours i decide to leave because of a review where the staff seem distract or disinterested in my presence the office admin very nice call me to inform i be miss my appointment i explain to her that there be too many indications where this be not go to be a good fit and wish her the best of luck i recommend if you see this dentist you go to the front door furthest away from the park lot for the entrance poor recommendation because the staff who walk by me seem to be distract which be point out in a previous review this be by far the best dentist i have ever be to she be honest and never try to sell you a bunch a stuff that you dont need we be very great full that we discover her we adjust our vacation to make sure that we stop in to her office in pennsylvania at least once a year for clean and check up worth the drive from florida ive be to this office a good amount of time each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it be very uncomfortable dr weinberg herself be very nice but i doubt her ability every procedure she have do to my teeth have backfire the third and last issue i have be that i always pay cash at the end of my visit and somehow i have receive an invoice for 55 i call and of course the receptionist be sassy and rude so i give up will never go back or refer anyone else don don be a restaurant i find myself miss now and again its probably my favorite restaurant in carnegie simple setup just a small restaurant with a few table and a tv oddly enough i think my favorite thing to eat there be the wonton soup never have better the food be average but i always enjoy eat there great service and a cheap place to get chinese food take it from me avoid this place at all cost the only time i go be when i be starve and dont have the energy to cook or get edible food and then after i have be kick myself far away from real chinese food doesnt even taste good as american style chinese food i use to order takeout here once every month or so the food taste average and the price be good its your typical lowend chinese place the last and final time i order here i just so happen to be pick up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department be make his round while i be wait on my food which take much longer than usual the inspector be point out violations he also request a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register be unable to produce the inspector look at me like i be crazy for wait on my food despite the obvious poor condition as for the rest of the place its always be kind of dirty inside the carpet be just filthy and the wall match there be always childrens toy scatter about the floor because the owners children be always there so be careful not to trip the workers do seem like nice people just try to make a live but when it come to cleanliness don don be lack delicious singapore noodles and seafood delight crispy flavorful crab rangoon and cold sesame noodles do well but couldve use a bite more sauce excellent real chinese food friendly service restaurant ambience high school cheap date quality i come here with two friends prior to visit apis meadery next door this past weekend i order the general tsos chicken and my friends order the sesame chicken crab rangoon and another appetizer egg roll they order the combo with less meat and i order the one with morethe name be very similar which i find confuse the food take quite a while to come up 15 min so id suggest call ahead if youre in a rush while we be wait the woman behind the counter yell at someone over the phone in chinese and then at a guy who come in to pick up food for delivery probably the same person to be honest im not much of a fan of americanize chinese cuisine i live in singapore for 3 mos and have visit hong king and japan its be awhile since ive have it and this dish remind me why i dont care for the overbear sweetness and thickness of the sauce nor do i care for the precut meat in the dish i like to cut up my own meat thank you very much so the flavor and textures dont do much for me have say that my friends claim this be the best americanize chinese fare theyd have in pgh and they live in squirrel hill so if youre a fan of this cuisine you can take that into consideration if nothing else this meal provide us with some muchneeded food to absorb the alcohol from the mead which i appreciate all i can say be the worst we be the only 2 people in the place for lunch the place be freeze and load with kid toy 2 bicycle a scooter and an electronic keyboard grace the din room a fish tank with filthy slimy fingerprint smear all over it be there for your enjoyment our food come no water to drink no tea medium temperature food of course its cold just like the room i never take my jacket off the plat be too small you food spill over onto some semiclean table as you sit in your completely wear out booth seat the fry noodles be out of a box and nasty the shrimp be mushy the fry rice be bright yellow we ask for water they bring us 1 in a solo cup for 2 people i ask for hot tea they say 10 minutes what chinese restaurant do not have hot tea available upon request over all my first and last visit to this place the only good point be that it be cheap and deservingly so we go on a weeknight place be not busy wait over 20 minutes for drink and to have our order take we order an app and it come out with the meals and that be another 20 minutes or so food be luke warm at best i would not go back go for breakfast on 61614 we receive very good service and meal come within a few minuteswaitress could have smile more but be friendly i have a grand slam it be more than enough food meal be very tasty we will definitely go back it be a popular dennys i love their stake and i come here every week just to get the t bone steak it be completely delicious great atmosphere there be always a lot people and the waiters be nice food portion be great as well perfect time with hubby after work which be 4 be and you can still have a hot nice meal waitress be such an adorable girl her arm be break or smth but she still dis a great job strawberry lemonade be just smth i have be crave for for so long but do not know what it be strawberry milkshake nachos and t bone steak be smth we never stop order its always nice when u go late at night like us it be not crowd not noisy nice music play and always nice people around if you want smth quick and it be late at night then i would say dennys this location never disappoint food be always consistently great and if you come at the right time witch hours you may see the cook sing and dance along with the music in the back and it be awesome love this place i belong to this gym i live in the south section of pittsburgh and i find that this gym be not too far from me the staff be friendly the equipment be quite good you get two free personal train sessions when you join they have lot of weight which my boyfriend use and a decent cardio room the only thing i would say be to increase some of the cardio equipment water be only 1 a bottle i buy a three month membership last year mainly to attend the silver sneakers class i be in my early sixties and hadnt exercise in a while i try the even class but they be very crowd and difficult so i try a morning class for seniors i like to stretch out before my class actually start so i go to the tail end of a yoga class the women in this class be very nasty to me and tell me that i wasnt welcome to stretch out in their class i never go back thank to the attitude of the other members i didnt feel welcome here i complain to the manager who say that i be welcome to stretch out in whatever class i want to but the hostility of these yoga students be very evident do they think that this be their private gym i really like this gym it be nice neighborhood gym and unlike big gyms they dont have big contract and they have flexible memberships great selection of class all the instructors be very good knowledgable and motivate all the staff work there be super nice their selection of the equipment be good too if you like be greet in the morning by a gym worker slop down egg from a fry pany instead of workingthis be your gymcomplain to the manager and she get nastytry get in touch with the ownerimpossible most unprofessional gym ever i bring my husband and my parent all to papa js last time my husband and i be in pittsburgh my parent be really picky about their italian food usually they drive place in east bumf tarentum ligonier to get their capital italian my pop be kinda grumbly and get him to try something new be like pull teeth the only reason i get him here be becuase they be on their way to drop us at the airport well my dad go back now regularly and that say a lot consider he live in murrysville the first good sign dad be happy be that he seem impress when it be open it be noon a few days after christmas second good sign be that dad order wine at it be only 1 pm dad while not a teetotaler rarely have a drink before 5 pm so i know he be anticipate a good meal the kicker be that he be so happy he leave our waitress a 20 tip on a 50 meal can i say i live in texas now and i still relive this afternoon back in december i have chicken picattait be perfect my dad have eggplant rollatini my mom have a pizza and my hubby have basic pasta and marinara it all be amaze delicous and inexpensive in austin you cant get a decent italian meal much less a decent italian meal for under 50 for four people i know there be so many good italian place in pittsburgh but i just think back so fondly on this daywhen me dad like someplace i take him papa js be by far my favorite restaurant in pittsburgh my hometown i eat there almost every time i visit and everything ive ever order have be fantastic fresh ingredients simple preparation reasonable price also they make the best pizza in town hand down this be one of my husband fave restaurants in town my husband generally order chicken parm which be very good their sauce be quite good they serve fresh bread with a plate of olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dip yum i generally order one of their house salads think it have a specific name but cant recall off the top of my head which have mix green and i get it with blue cheese pine nut and their yummy vinaigrette a tad pricey for a salad thats just lettuce and cheese i want to say about 8 with the extras but really good especially with some crack black peeper i tend to follow this up with a smaller plate like their red pepper app or the green bean the place have sort of a rustic atmosphere and can be on the loud side it have a comfortable feel it also have a solid wine by the glass selection better than a lot of place in the burgh unfortunately weve never have dessert there bc we get so full of bread and dinner thank yelpers for this find the service the plat the ambiance be wonderful i have the eggplant parmigiana and it be good but different it be thinly slice like deli meat and wasnt bread it be fry in a very light batter this place have be a favorite for 20 years since we return from a trip to italy have several weeks of fabulous fresh food and couldnt think of any place we want to eat papa js measure up to our expectations with great salads bead and wine im partial to the eggplant rollatini and my husband like samplers ravioli fish white pizza i like the space with expose brick wallsthere be knowledgeable servers sometimes it be a bite loud more noticable when it be empty with a large table nearby but dont get the wrong impression its a great placeconsistantly great food great authentic classic italian restaurant in one of the most unlikely place i grow up eat here and make a visit nearly every time i come to town try the fry calamari roman style for a little kick ive be to papa js twice and have mix experience both time i have the banana pepper appetizer which be great and go really well with the fresh and delicious bread and cheese they give you at the start of your meal for entrees me and my girlfriend have have mix experience ive have the fish sandwich very good and the eggplant parm sandwich okay my girlfriend get the salad with bread and basil on it but the basil be over power and the bread be soggy with the dress the service be also a mix bag the first time our server go out of her way to take care of us and even make me cocktail sauce for my fish sandwich the second time the server be lackluster didnt know anything about the menu and wasnt able to take proper care of us i would return to papa js but i my terrible experience last time isnt enough to say it would be my first pick of place to eat around carnegierobinson i go there for dinner last night with a client this be second time i visit i have a scotch and he have a guiness the 1 be for drink selection just stock some better beers and higher end scotch and youre five star we start with the meatballs cover with provolone and other bless goodness these do not disappoint i have a four cheese pizza with sweet sausage and garlic it be fantastic they have so many good dish but i want the pizza last night i couldnt finish the pizza way to go big medium pizza i finish up with a coffee the park can be a bite of a challenge on the street but its a small town atmosphere in carnegie pa i love the downtown there what a wonderful surprise find in carnegie pa just south of pittsburgh i be in town on business with a couple coworkers and after have a not so great meal the night before we ask one of the locals for a recomendation they tell us to try this little italian place call papa js and boy do they send us to a great place first off when you walk up to the place the front and side windows give you a fantastic open view into the kitchen from the outside you can stand outside and watch the chef make all the wonderful food and you can smell the fresh bread before you even walk in the door i be not sure how long this place have be around but the kitchen look well use while the din area as well as the bar look very clean and modern almost as if it have be freshly update the server be quick to welcome us and suggest several different items off the menu as his favorites when ask the three of us be very hungry and want to try a few different things so we begin with a margherita pizza which be absolutely perfect they obviously make their own bread and dough for the pizza and i dont think this pizza could have taste any better then come bowl of italian wed soup which be pretty good of everything there this be the one item i probably could have do without not that it be bad but there be nothing particularly special about it we also order the garlic roll not that the bread they already give you and the pizza be not enough carbs for 1 meal and they be to die for crunchy on the outside and warm and chewy inside these things be a meal by themselves one of the guy with me say the pizza sauce would be good on them so he order a cup of the pizza sauce which be fresh make there not out of some can and he be right as if these little killer bread ball with garlic be not good enough dip in the pizza sauce they be even that much better by the time our meals come we be all pretty full but we push on and continue to eat i have the veal parmigiano which be tender and very good it come with a side of pasta which i taste just to try and it be excelent as well have i not be eat a weeks worth of carbs in one sit with all the premeal stuff i certainly would have finish it as it be i eat most but not all of the generous portion of veal one of my coworkers have the chicken picatta which he say be one of the best he have ever have and the other guy try a pasta dish which he say be very good as well they have a great wine selection as well at reasonable price by the glass or bottle overall a fantastic experience with great food and atmosphere i dont really know how expensive the area be for food but come from the chicagoland area i fouknd this place to be pretty reasonable the three of us eat very very well for an average of aproximately 30 each not include alcahol fantastic fresh food at a reasonable price who could ask for more my only complaint be that i have to return to chicago and i be now crave to return to papa js i hope work send me out here again sometime soon yay im a fan but sometimes service be a little slow it be very good for us this visit go to papa js every once in a while but mostly for the white pizza it be the best white pizza i have ever have order the white pizza on our visit this weekend it have garlic spinach feta cheese and we usually add some veggie on top it be delicious order fry calamari and it be oknote to self next time try the calamari roman style like the din room with the hardwood floor and bright light the bar be jump thou never go to the bar terrible service food unremarkable waiter disappear for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staff mismanagement save his tip by discount meal after i complain all and all a very crude and unpleasant din experience for me and my guests not to be repeat never again yay im a fan of the white pizza have take out the bar be jump when i pick up our order the white pizza be so deliciouswith garlic spinach feta and add some veggies try the roman style calamari very good better than the fry calamari we have last time we meet our good friends from morgantown here for lunch today and be really impress with the place itself and the menu i have read a few of the review ahead of time and the pizza be mention more than once so by the time we get there i be jonesing for it it certainly deliver the crust be great the sauce wast too sweet and the toppings be sufficient our friend for the baby clam with oil and garlic over angel hair and let me try a bite as good as the pizza be this be much better well return again to this beautifully light gem in carnegie pa soon ok its friday night and have about 70 minutes to eat drive by papa js and w say let stop in and get a quick dinner advice host that we be in a hurry the host advise us it be a 90 minute service the place be crowd we be seat at the last open table however our waiter jason say he will do his best to get as out on time we order our dinner immediately with a salad and a glass of wine in a few minutes we have our wine then in a few more second we have our salads and some great homemade italian bread with some olive oil and balsamic ving for dip yum just as we be finish our salads our dinners be deliver great job jason the fettuccine carbanara be very good a thick cream sauce with bacon and ricotta in and out in 60 minutes now that be some good service great little gem the food be fantastic be very food and just the right price the italian food be amaze but you can not leave without a dessert and be prepare for giant serve i have the carrot cake yummy def a place everyone should try i have to say that i write this review with much regret because i have always love papa js but my recent experience there have change my mind a bite from the minute we be seat we be greet by a server that be clearly inexperienced and didnt know the menu as i say before ive be to papa js a good handful of time so i know the menu decently well but the server couldnt explain any of the question i have about a couple new dish i be think about try i swear this guy must have just look at the menu for the first time a few minutes ago but it wasnt just the knowledge of the menu it be one thing after another with our server my wife ask for a glass of water 4 time until she finally get it at which point the meal be over so we didnt care at that point i mean come on for a restaurant of this calibre and price be it too much to ask for a glass of water there be no one fill up water my biggest complaint however be what happen with our meals my dad and i both order the trout special trout with roast red pepper and lump crabmeat instead the meal that be deliver to both of us be trout with a heap pile of spinach and mushroom not what the special be at all and by the way that item be on the menu as a regular item so whether or not the mistake be make by the server which we be sure it be or the chef who know for certain not to mention though that a good server wouldnt have serve us that regardless but before you think we have an unusal experience that be all due to a poor server let me continue when we inform our server of the mistake he didnt really believe us until he check his order sheet and then he blame the error on the chef at this point the meal have be sit because it take us forever to flag this guy down again so the trout be basically cold the server then say he would have the meals remake so he take the meals back to the kitchen meanwhile of course my wife and mom be eat their meals and my dad and i be sit there with no meals also keep in mind that my wife still have not get the water she have be ask for and my ice tea have be refill with a soda yes believe that or not all the kitchen do be scrape their mistake off of our fish they didnt remake anything our fish be serve to us again with little piece of spinach and mushroom stick all over it quite frankly the fish wasnt good at all i honestly would have rather have a fish sandwich from mcdonalds that night the server never do anything to try to make our experience better he know we werent happy but never offer anything such as dessert on the house im not look for a handout but our experience be just plain awful that night the guy never really even apologize for the mistake normally i may have ask for a manager but at this point i be ready to just get out of there plus we have to be somewhere else that night my opinion for the money there be many other restaurants i would rather eat at this be a regular goto for me i love the food and the service they always have the wine that i like and the food be always delicious i suggest try the flourless chocolate cake in the front of the store in the section where you can buy stuff to take home it be sublime and make you want to go to a special cozy corner just to eat it and revel in its velvety loveliness i think the interiors be very nice we stop here on a friday night i be glad they werent busy because nothing else in the area look appetizing my daughter i split a chicken parm sandwich which be really good instead of it be serve on a hoagie it be serve on thin bread like focaccia or something it be pretty good little messy the desserts look amaze i think it be pretty cool how you can watch the cook prepare the food from outside the kitchen be situate on a corner with lot of windows i would return san francisco california visitor like the food and the local be great i be think about relocate to pttsbrgh area i like carnegie because u can stroll down main street and hit a couple place for lunch i imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night we eat a lunchtime and it be nice come here you get the feel they havent change much the table the decorations the menu all the same do that make you a little worry yes i order the mushroom ravioli and it be oily very very oily the actual ravioli be okay enough mushroom but it be oily do i mention that ambiance like i say leave much to be desire i dont think id have this place on my list of musts for downtown much better restaurants to visit have dinner at papa js with a group of 6 i love how the restaurant be in a old brick build with large windows it felt like a neighborhood restaurant on a saturday night the restaurant be full but not crowd we be seat in a room with poor acoustics it be difficult to hear people at our table and the waitress while she try i can see the asperation in her face when she have to repeat the specials to both side of the table people order bourbon on the rock before dinner which seem water down while my lemon drop be make nice the bread be delicious can you describe it to be creamy the fry zucchini be lightly bread and not too oily it be a large portion make up of 2 slice zucchinis we order a variety of dish the pasta dish be dry with more pasta than sauce or meat those who order the fish special think it be delicious the shrimp dish be enjoy as well i have the chicken marsala which be pretty good the marsala sauce wasnt too thick and the chicken moist hard to tell if the desert be homemade the tiramisu and spumoni be small in portion and mean for one on the whole i be on the fence with my overall impression of papa js aok probably be the best way to describe it service in this place be poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people work there be just work they have nice decornice bar and good bread consider where this place be the price be really really high nothing be serve on the side with main dish terrible serviceterrible foodthis place smell like rotten wet wood great place for dinner drink or a small celebration papa js be one of my favorite go to place for dinner when we dont have reservations and want a nice dinner out my husband and i have eatten here upwards of 20 time over the last few years and have never be disappoint i assume that when they open the alternate bar with lounge area and extra table for din on the other side of the resturant that the overall vibe of the restaurant would change and it would be very busy i have be prove wrong we be always able to walk in on a weekend and get a table within a few minutes unfortunately the alternate barlounge area isnt always open i really dont understand why more people dont go here my favorites be the fry zucchini wed soup and pizzathe zucchini be always crispy and season well the wed soup have big chunk of carrots and celery my husband also enjoy the pork entrees especially the grill pork and the pastas include the tomato cream sauce also their homemade italian bread with oil and vinegar to dip be a great way to wet your appetite make sure to add the parmesan cheese that they put on the table also if you be look for a good place to host a birthday party or event consider papa js they have a great cater menu and be easily able to accomodate larger party we have our rehersal dinner for our wed here and everyone love the food although the first impression through the door be charm and the aroma entice as you enter this restaurant much can be improve upon for the price ask for the din experience our group of 7 have call a week ahead and be seat in the back of the far din room right by a door where clink pot pan and dish be hear throughout our meal as well as a darth vader type noise come from the ceiling vent our waitress be not knowledgable of all menu items and three of our very simple request do not come out as order dress on the side of a salad less feta on an entree and no oil on another entree the waitress blame it on the cook but do offer to get one entree change also we be ask if we want pine nut feta or gorgonzola on our salad and then be charge 200 extra per item in addition to the salad price 699 which bring the salad up to 1099 outrageous there be so much possibility for ambiance in this restaurant but they miss the mark on service and atmosphere i will most likely not return very overprice for the quality and service papa js be expensive and inconsistent the ambiance be nice but it doesnt justify the price there be better restaurants in carnegie very good restaurant with very good food at a pretty reasonable price we have a birthday dinner here with seven girlfriends the waitress be very efficient but not very friendly our order come out hot and excellently prepare try the tilapia milanese its excellent best steam broccoli ive ever have i be pleasantly surprise by this restaurant come here with no expectations i be greet by a large open garage style window that open the whole lounge bar area to the street it have modern furnish and the staff be quite friendly order the quattro formaggi pizza quite good great balance of cheese not too rich at all crust be excellent too cant wait to come back just to start off we be a party of 12 which be always a little difficult we be celebrate 2 birthdays we love the food it be delicious my husband get a chicken parm sandwich which be serve on a yummy flat bread and i get the chicken basil pizza i get an 8 cut and several ppl try it we all love it it be stun it be make with a very delicious crust nice and crisp not soggy like pesto pizza can get the one waitress we have jasmine be fantastic she be bright friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu she take extra time with the older ladies in our group to help them with their selections now the other waitress mary something be so incompetent she be awful and rude she miss 2 people on that side of the table fail to take their order and when we say something she say well they didnt speak up ugh then when it be time to sing and cut the cake my sister in law say oh hey can you get the cake so we can sing she come back cut the cake all crazy with some huge piece and some super small piece like she never in her life cut a sheet cake and we didnt even sing we be mad the place be so pretty they have a new addition that be just build within the last 2 years accord to my father in law and its really nice they look to have a cool bar area with some modern couch and a really sweet look so good food great look place one bad waitress price be about middle of the road for an authentic italian place nothing crazy all in all wed like to go back again but we want jasmine i be amaze that people can write negative review about papa js i have be a return customer since the early 90s and the food quality and service be way above averageand especially for this price range kudos to management for maintain such a level of quality and freshness nothing we have tonight be disappoint and we overordered because each dish be delectable the best item tonight be the mozzarella appetizer cradle in bread with an authentic marinara the white pizza with sundried tomatoes be as usual out of this world good the scallop special appetizer be phenomenal we will be back absolutely awful service go to papa js awhile ago and the service be bad the waiter be surly rude and unhelpful decide to try it

friday night 81 for a round of drink there be 7 of us altogether and we have eat at another restaurant earlier in the even one member of our party walk up to the bar to let them know we be sit on the couch along the wall as it be fairly busy that night in the short time that he be there a man who be behind the bar look at him and then turn away without say a word or notify anyone else he then turn to a waitress who have approach the service area of the bar and ask her if we could have a server take our drink order she say yep and then abruptly turn and walk away at that point he ask to see the manager who come a few minutes later when my friend tell him of what have occur the manager say what do you want me to do my friend say an apology would be a good start whereupon the manager look back at him and say get out and dont come back be you kid my friend be well travel and frequently stay at higher end hotels and din at quality restaurants he be not scream or belligerent in any way shape or form simply inform the manager of what have occur that be say we leave and go back to 131 east where we have previously eat the service there be fabulous as be the meal and the drink creative and exquisite there be new restaurants that have open in carnegie as of late papa js be no longer the only game in town obviously this be the way a simple complaint be handle by management appal do yourself a favor and frequent any of the other restaurants that be within walk distance of papa js they understand the concept of customer service some of the best chow aroundlove this place the bread and salads and soup be great finally great tuscanstyle italian food in pittsburgh not that tasteless stuff that locals think be italian the bread be warm and fresh the bolognese sauce be creamy and rich and unlike most restaurants be make with veal i love the fresh smell of bake bread throughout the restaurant im look forward to work my way through the menu of chicken options and next time im save room for dessert the display of cake and pastries at the door be amaze man have this place go down hill my husband and i go a couple of weeks ago we have salads and pasta both be on the verge of inedible with a single glass of wine i felt downright rob at the 50 price tag seriously i could have easily make what we have with jar sauce and box pasta at home classico be better and the service be pretty absent to make it even worse seem she know it be terrible and didnt want to deal with it seriously id rather eat at the og food be not good at all my husband i eat here a couple weeks ago for the first time i order a salad basil pesto cream pasta my husband order the spinach feta pasta the salad be just a huge plate of spring mix nothing else in it with way to much vinegar dress my lettuce be drown in the vinegar my pesto pasta have no flavor do not taste like a cream sauce to me the pesto be so runnywatery way too much sauce not enough noodles my husband pasta have even less flavor than mine we eat about a quarter of the food couldnt even finish it we take it home it be so bad i didnt even eat my leftovers and i hate waste food plus the price be expensive for the amount of food you get of course the poor quality dont waste your time eat here there be much better italian restaurants in pittsburgh talk about overprice 18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously freeze chicken chop up over it the latter be terrible thin and flabby and rather unappealing the pasta itself be ok as be the sauce the desserts be pretty good but honestly that be a 10 dish whose price have be inflate im up in the air about how i feel regard emmert dental be that it be locate in market square can be both a good or bad thing park be scarce not to mention you have to pay for it yet you have great restaurants and coffee place around you the office itself be old and raggedy look but the staff be young and hip i think possibly a little too young and hip my dentist know what she be do but i didnt adore her im still work out my bill because they charge me too much on my copay and dont really seem to have all their info together after a clean and fill i think im go to look for somewhere else to get my future dental work do ive decide where i stand with emmert dental they be unprofessional rude and have no clue what theyre do behind the desk i will not be go back nor will i have nice things to say about them the worst dental experience of my life they be butcher my husband and i go to emmert dental in bethel park for a routine clean and check up i have one tooth that i have a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that need fill after the so call dentist dr carnavali do my exam i need 3 additional root canal and an extraction an extraction on the tooth that just have a root canal i be tell that part of the tooth have break off and that a crown be no longer possible i didnt know any better so i agree to schedule the extraction for a few weeks later the dentist want to extract it that day but i have plan for the weekend and be not about to be in pain so 2 weeks later i go in for the extraction after they give me novocaine they get me with you need a bone graft also in that area since we be extract that tooth i have never have any issue with bone loss with previous extractions so i didnt feel it be necessary i have 3 employees surround me pressure me for this bone graft so i reluctantly agree i have to pay 25900 for this bone graft so i sign everything i wasnt even give enough time to read the document so i should have know and get up and leave right then and there the dentist start the extraction i have never be so uncomfortable in my life he pull on my tooth use a metal instrument to pound on my tooth and be pull so hard that my head be come up and slam back down against the head rest finally after a good 15 minutes of this torture he rip the tooth out of the side of my jaw i be literally gang from all the blood run down the back of my throat he then stick some pink powder up in the extraction area im assume this be the bone graft i end up with many stitch i be give an antibiotic and instruct to schedule an appointment for the follow saturday so they could start the bridge then i be hit with a bill of 56900 my insurance cover 100 of extractions i be in so much pain for 2 weeks follow the extraction pain severe enough that i have to call off work and i couldnt sleep at night i refuse to go back to emmert dental and after a visit to a very reputable dentist an endodontist and an oral surgeon i have to have oral surgery to try and repair the damage emmert dental have do to my mouth they cause a very large deformity in my jaw and i be at risk to lose additional teeth save yourself a lot of time money and pain emmert dental only care about the money will over charge you and leave you less than happy with the dental work they be butcher and should not even call themselves dentist and if you have an issue with their bill practice dont expect to that resolve easily i have call numerous time and i be always tell that the manager and or bill department be not in i have contact the bbb and a lawyer i expect and want a full refund no one should have to go thru what i be currently go thru they do unnecessary extractions so they can do a more expensive procedure such as a bridge or an implant now i have to go thru oral surgery more pain and suffer and more time miss from work because of emmert dental and the root canal they say i need my current dentist and my endodontist both agree that i do not need tooth canal in fact the teeth be perfectly healthy they be crook and butcher the worst dental office i ever be no one can beat it you should avoid it at any time eat at your own risk the service be terrible the staff seem to be generally clueless the management be incline to blame the staff for their own mistake and theres no sense of fast in their fast food when we come half of the menu board be still on breakfast and it be 430p the only thing they have go for them be that the food be hot and taste just like mcdonalds should then again the franchise be own by rice and ive come to take terrible service be their mo my expectations for mcdonalds be t rarely high but for one to still fail so spectacularlythat take something special the cashier take my friendss order then promptly ignore me i have to force myself in front of a cashier who open his register to wait on the person behind me i wait over five minutes for a gigantic order that include precisely one kid meal after watch two people who order after me be hand their food i ask where mine be the manager start yell at the cashier for serve off their order when they didnt have their food but neither cashier be anywhere near those control and the manager be the one serve food to customers and clear the board the manager be rude when give me my order she didnt make sure that i have everything on my receipt and never even have the decency to apologize that i felt i be get poor service ive eat at various mcdonalds restaurants for over 30 years ive work at more than one location i expect bad days bad moods and the occasional mistake but i have yet to have a decent experience at this store it will remain a place i avoid unless someone in my party need to avoid illness from low blood sugar perhaps i should go back to the racially bias service of steak n shake instead ive try to give this mcdonalds a chance but my patience have run out the only reason why i come here as much as i do be because i like the 1 ice coffees but its not even worth it this mcdonalds be poo and so be most of the staff whenever i want to go through the drivethru i cant because there be a line of cars wrap half away around the build and even when the line be shorter theres always a hold up of some sort so most of the time i just park and go inside the restaurant today be a horrible day i order an ice coffee no cream or sugar and a chocolate chip cookie it only take 30 second to fill a cup with coffee and 30 second to take a cookie out of the case i wait 10 minutes sorry but thats too long just to get a coffee and a cookie its not like i order a meal during that time i saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and ice coffees within two minutes wth i tell the petite sleepy eye cashier i want my money back her eye open wide in surprise like i really wake her up or something she saidyoure the one who order the ice coffee i can get it for you for real she be the one who take my order i tell her i wait too long and i just want my money back the manager offer to make my ice coffee but i refuse because i have just have enough there be few employees there who work hard but everyone else be drag their feet there be no organization or teamwork everyone be scrabble it look like none of them want to be there i use to work in fast food and i know it suck but come on im sorry but i cant recommend this mcdonalds its poo im not come back here anymore guess ill be go to starbucks and their ice coffees taste better anyway this mcdonalds be so bad its amaze order big mac large fry diet coke the soda machine be break no sodas then i get to the window we ring you up for medium fry not what i ask for well if you want a large youre gonna have to wait 4 minutes we just start a new batch leave with big mac medium fry no coke actually now that i think about it this be one of my better experience there we have the worst possible experience at the eat n park at waterfront on 21210 at around 10pm our waitress annemarie be inattentive and get us the wrong order we end up with a dish we have not even order and still get charge for it on the check one of my friends order a buffalo chicken sandwich which accord to the menu description shouldve have lettuce and tomato in it but the sandwich that arrive on our table have none of those ingredients when point out to the waitress she just bring some lettuce and tomatoes in a plate how crude speak to the manager after pay the full check and first of all she do not even offer to reimburse for the item we do not even order and that have be forcibly thrust upon us when i ask the manager about the buffalo chicken sandwich not have any lettuce and tomato she say they just get new menus and that description be not correct and that buffalo chicken sandwich be suppose to be without lettuce and tomato what a lame excuse even your online menu say under the description for a buffalo chicken sandwich that its suppose to have both those ingredients serve with lettuce and tomato on a freshbaked kaiser roll thats what the last line in the description of buffalo chicken sandwich say shame on you manager for lie instead of admit her fault she be blame it to a new menu not only do we have to pay for something that we didnt order or eat but we get substandard food that be different from what be describe in the menu and have to deal with a really bad waitress and insensitive and deceitful manager to top off the whole experience i be never go to come back to any eat n park location ever again and will never recommend one to any of my friends either what a waste of time and money plus deal with callous and lie people my goodness i surely have my patience test this even this company represent a honest and care company that care about their community they operate a variety of businesses and restaurants include the eat n park locations the new porch in shenley six and penn kitchen and the new upcoming hello bistro i cannot wait to try all of their din place they burn my fish and they burn it bad order fish at eatn park be always a gamble i just never know how its go to turn out im a risk taker so i order two piece of bake lemon sole well it go terribly wrong my waiter come out and say they burn your fish so i have them put two new piece in the oven i be impress by his honesty and didnt mind wait for two new piece i gladly help myself to my boyfriends french toast while i wait then out of no where another server come to the table with the burn fish and set it down infront of me with the burn side down of course that just show the kitchen be not in total coordination like i say get fish from eatn park be a toss up in the end i get two nicely bake piece of sole to replace the burn ones so i leave satisfy some how even though the food at this eatn park be down right abominable the smile and laughter be always there how can i stay mad when the price or so cheep myself my boyfriend and his nephew have lunch with milkshakes and me have a coffee it be 3100 on this particular occasion the fire alarm go off and ring and ring and ring loud and long for over 15 minutes before the fire department get there realize they didnt have key to turn it off and than another 10 minutes later finally shut it offonly at eatn park my bake potato be hard as a rock i have order two piece of bake cod and only receive one the waitress be very sweet and attentive and really attempt to build a rapport with our lil nephew which i think be sweet this be a tiny starbucks and it locations like this although cute make you wonder if your really mean to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave leave be always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with bench and it be a central part of the waterfront shop starbuck isnt my favorite coffee chain by any mean be it just me or do all starbuck coffees taste a little burn and bitter no matter how trendy cool and upscale their establishments be i cant get around the yicky taste bitterness of staryucks regular coffees talk about over roast a beanmaybe something have change with their regular coffee but i have not drink it in about a year i be not one for soy caramel latte foofy stuff still ill give the establishment tres estrellas for the fact that their espresso be acceptable and doesnt taste half as bad as the regular coffee bean friendly staff same starbucks fair you get anywhere else sometimes the line can get long mmmpeppermint mocha in my quest to visit every starbucks in the usa i have stop at yet another location this one be locate in the center of a circle road very cache and in a newer part of the area typical starbucks coffee chain 2 things i dont like about this starbucks 1 ive be there twice and both time the place have be dirty compare to the other starbucks i have be in 2 if you have to use the bathroom they give you a key thats attach to this nasty bottle im pretty sure they dont clean that bottle after every use or even nightly aside from that good coffee and fastfriendly service if there be ever a get your coffee and go starbucks this be it right in the center of the waterfront this starbucks have no sofa comfy chair only table seat i love the baristas here but i dont like the location of the build this be a typical starbucks the coffee be good but the store be suprisingly dirty i have to agree with joe on this one the baristas be extremely friendly and the service be great but the fact that there be no comfy chair or couch be very unwelcoming i do think however that the build be beautifully ans strategically locate in the center of the shop i just wish they have better seat i just realize they remodel this one recentlyish well in my world recently because its be a while since ive be here theyve add more seat which make it way more conducive to have a meet here which be my concern during the week i imagine during the weekend it just fill up with tweens get their sugar rush before hit the movie theater the coffee or tea for me be still same old same old i dont imagine one single starbucks will break the mold and make original drink great location close to shop and theatre nice staff regard quality of beverage this be just your average starbucks i cant complain but be not blow away either however i really like the location of this shop which be locate in the center of the waterfronts specialty retail shop though in the midst of a lot of retail the surround area be very picturesque with pretty green grass flower and a fountain hang out here be very relax i love the location of this starbucks which be why im give it 4 star its right smack in the middle of clothe store the loews movie theater as well as restaurants i love grab a mid afternoon latte here on a saturday while peruse various store such as the gap or loft i also like come here before or after a movie for a quick caffeine jolt while the drink be the same as you would find at any starbucks the baristas and staff be really friendly perhaps more so than other area starbucks my drink or choice when i come here generally in the mod afternoon be a venti or trenta berry hibiscus refresher yum it be the perfect afternoon pickmeup that leave me feel refresh and hydrate this starbucks be teenytiny seat inside be very limit this be a starbucks to grab and go and continue your shop at the waterfront baristas be friendly and fast as far as starbucks go this be a pretty nice one the baristas be friendly and while i be here a lot of regulars must have come in because they banter away with almost everyone the bathroom be clean and well maintain and the trash wasnt overflow in the canisters around the store the pastries look fresh but i didnt partake the noise level be also at a nice work level not too loud music just barely audible i do wish there be more seat it be nice that this location have a counter at the end of the bar for sole workers but it doesnt replace more table im sure this isnt as much of a problem in the summer when theres the space outside there be a treat receipt promo go on but the barista didnt tell me about it which i find odd usually when they have promos like that go on they ask everyone if they want their receipt to come back later in the day to claim whatever the offer be today it be one of their new pastries for 1 i know in the summer they do 2 grande ice drink with that mornings receipt overall nice work or socialize environment very friendly and invite its what ive come to expect from starbucks so point for consistency im not a huge fan of this location i think that it be oddly build the small alleylike front make it difficult to get past people on your way tofrom the bathroom or table when its busy and theres hardly any table to sit at furthermore people tend to clog the front on their way in which make things particularly difficult especially in the winter weather the staff be pretty impersonal to be but maybe that be due to the high traffic of the place and the time i be there and the coffee that i have be cold im sure it be probably the bottom of the batch id probably only walk in here again if someone else suggest it before or after a movie or while we be shop in the area this starbucks be 5star friendly the shift supervisor lucious keep the energy in there move and light he recently help me with a merchandise return and embody everything a good manager and all around mensch person should patience kindness generosity and fairness i leave that afternoon love starbucks even more than when i go in its great that a company and their employees can be as loyal to their customers as their customers be to them i be always so please with the customer service here for such a tiny starbucks the do a really great job serve the mass that come in there and still manage to take the time to be friendly in the midst of the frenzy outdoor seat in the summer be nice for someone who straddle the line between sometimes crafter this store can seem vast and confuse theres row and row of baskets and bedazzle jewel and paper andoh myscrap book when i want to find bore old feltits likewhere do i start im in a hurry as always and i rush in and the first thing i look for be an employee no one to be find i could call out and my voice would come echo back i run between row of paper wood and gosh darn scrap bookingno felt where do i find felt where do i find an employee finally i find one after 15 minutes of wonder around shes incredibly nice and lead me to the felt this be not the first time ive be hard up to find help i tell her she be hard to find and she tell me that theyre low on payroll and cant have any one the floor but her in that whole store just her thats ridic not a month ago i be again in a slight hurry and stand in line for about 15 minutes to check out with 2 employees at the register and 6 people per line i give up and walk out hey michael do you pick up what im put down youre not make any money because your costumer service sucksin fact theres no service to be find i have be frequently shop at this michaels store over the last couple months since i begin take a cake decorate class and host a large baby shower at my home the store have typically have the supply that i need from cake and cupcake bake and ice to scrap book supply this location be pretty average compare to other michaels its exactly what you would expect when go to this store its not a large store but its not a small store just average i do enjoy use the michaels coupons when shop i definitely save a lot of money instead of tot around the paper versions i actually have the iphone app that have coupons available to use from the app my only complaint be that sometimes it take a while to check out at this location i dont normally have a problem usually only one or two people ahead of me but sometimes it can be much slower today for example there be only two customers ahead of me but one of them be have issue with a coupon the line begin to get longer and longer and though a couple associate be linger up front they keep call for someone else from personal experience of be a manger in a retail store do not linger or let your associate linger near the cashier without jump on register whatever the reason may be that you be not help customers it still appear rude and make everyone more impatient its your typical chain craft store and let me reiterate that im not a craft person i walk in because i need dial rods for some sign i have now for be a chain store i be a bite upset because even though they have a decent selection the amount they have for each one i want be scarce imagine me stand there with different size of wood in my hand and just star in disbelief and for a piece of wood the price be a bite steep i will provably come back here but only for an item that i cannot find elsewhere or if im too lazy to drive further out its yet another michaels and its a very good one recommend always for those who love craft michaels be a godsend i come here pretty frequently for art and craft supply whatever michaels doesnt have i just order online from a different retailer some items be pricey but you can still find some good deal if you go all the way to the back of the store you can find interest clearance items customer service be average my favorite time to visit michaels be when summer be about to end and all the fall and halloween items be set out since i come here often i know where everything i need be however the store could use a new layout the one good thing i can say about michaels be that they have a wide variety of hobbies and craft include in their selection theyve get items for woodwork paint knit kid craft scrapbooks you name it the problem be the variety of products for your particular craft be probably dismal theyve get lot of cool items all over the store that youre convince that somehow you need because it be soooo cute and you could totally do something with it right the store feel clutter because there be so much stuff everywhere however if youre look for something specific good luck its not even a matter of the product be difficult to find in the store its that when you find the right section theres either nothing in stock or they simply dont even carry what you need i stop in for crochet supply and the yarn selection be laughable compare to many other craft store i end up go elsewhere for my stuff anyway plus the price at michaels be significantly more than other area craft store i usually only stop there if im already at tend waterfront id recommend check other craft store first unless you need glitter especially fine glitter michaels have the best glitter selectionquality of any store ive ever be to you would think their exorbitant price would at least buy some decent customer service not at this location they be totally understaffed and have almost nobody able or will to help you find anything this be a problem because they carry so many completely different products that its hard to find what you need expect to wait at least a half hour before get assistance the organization be disjoint especially depend on your project theres even a section call art supply i think that be kind of the point of the whole store what do it in however be how miserably they pack my picture frame the place next door wrap two dollar drink glass in paper to protect them but apparently michaels think a grocery bag be sufficient to protect a nice picture frame in bad weather so the inevitable happen and i drop the bag now i dont expect every place to be sympathetic even though it could have be pack better but when i ask for a refund they be down right rude hey i do drop the thing but some empathy would have be nice i wasnt completely out of line ask because a little bubble wrap and it would have be fine in the first place i will never be back to this or any other michaels whenever i be at the waterfront i would eat here the shake be good as be the shoestring fry and bake bean the sandwich be small thin patties of meat so you probably want at least a double overall pretty tasty the food be good and its cheap i mean really inexpensive 400 for a burger and fry add a coke and its like 10001300 for two people seldom if ever crowd service can be a tad slow but hit or miss they also do breakfast and its a great alternative to wait at eat and park try the shake theyre great its clean open 247 with hot shoe string fry and creative milkshakes what else do you want in life this be the absolute worst steak n shake ive ever be to the bf and i get lose around pittsburgh for 40 min try to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food the food itself be just so crappily make it be so bad and we have wait a ridiculous amount of time cmon steak n shake be basically a glorify mcds our waiter comped our whole meal if not for the compensation i would have be piss that we have to pay for such a crappy meal the bf on the other hand be more upset about the principle of the matter we have trek all that way just to get our steak n shake fix since both of us havent have it since our undergraduate days and it be a major fail i think im good with my steak n shake crave for a long time now ps the whole joint smell like major bo i go here at 3 pm between the lunch rush and the dinner rush and the restaurant be maybe 20 full i order the chili mac supreme to go i think i would be in and out within 510 minutes keep in mind that this restaurant even have a drivethru the expectation be quick service long story short my food never come the waitress tell me after i have be sit there wait for thirty minutes that the kitchen hadnt even start on my order yet so i tell her to cancel it and walk out now i see that others on yelp have warn about the slow service at this location wish i have look it up earlier i heart steak n shake i love the fact that the fry be shoestring the burgers get to you pretty fast theyre a little greasy and the food be super cheap i visit steak and shake on new years eve in preparation for an even of mostly tame party i be unnaturally attract to their wisconsin buttery burger which be a double patty cheeseburger top with grill onions between two buns that have be butter sound good right well i get this delicious diet abomination and discover that my buns have be dunk in butter the pearly gate of cholesterol lade heaven with the triglyceride angels be sing to me i take the liberty of increase my sodium intake by pour their burgerfries season on the buns and i literally get tear in my eyesmost likely from the salt overload but possibly because this be one of the most evilly decadent things i have eat in a long time this be not mean to be a fine din experience service wasnt fast but it wasnt slow it just kind of be however the waitress do get a point for explain that the order would take x amount of time to all patrons so i give them a pass for be upfront about it next trip to pgh be go to feature steak and shake i guarantee it well as steak n shake locations go this isnt the best one aroundbut it be burgers and fry that be open 247 the milkshakes be good pros always make fresh when you order con greasy but its burgers take longer than typical in drive thru but thats bc theyre make fresh service on a scale of 110 10 be awesome be a 4 in general i do like shake n steak but this location be a hit or miss location you never know what kind of quality or service youre go to find here a friend and myself go a few weeks back after a movie and it have to be one of the worst trip there ever you cant entirely blame the waitress since she be the only one there for the entire placepoor schedule on the managers part however while she cant be accountable for the slooooow service she be accountable for both order be incorrect the burgers be over cook and the fry be soggie and the milkshake be runny at best by far my worst visit to steak n shake rather typical sns have a good lunch crowd milkshake be good but not as good as enp down the street it take to long to get the burger for some reason 25 minutes i realize cook to order but this be a little long for sns order the guacamole steakburger and it only have a small portion of gaucnot your usual amountkitchen be not up to speed on portion size for some reason definitely do not look like the picture on the website oh well ah steak n shake you hit the spot after a night of drink open 24 hours drive thru or dine in with wonderful cheap greasy burgers chicken finger breakfast sandwich and shoestring fry youre faster and cheaper than eat n park plus your employees wear those adorable bow tie grant if we be at a fancy party i might act like i dont know you but deep down inside you know i heart you the only thing worse than the food be the service terrible wait staff couldnt even seat us before we and another party walk out without even be greet properly i observe several employees traipse out the front door several table who be wait for their food for a long time several employees just stand around out of direct view of the table a morbidly obese host that could barely physically walk from one end of the store to the other i think one server be high go there be a special request by a 7 year old get over a longish illness so that make the shabby treatment more enrage this place be s l o wlike so slow i have get up and leave after wait 30 minutes and not even be acknowledge by a server the food be okay def not worth the wait milkshakes be just okay as well booooooo i really like the chili burgers be fair and salads be pretty bad pretty hard to mess up a side salad as others have say you never know what kind of service you will get store be usually understaffed and cleanliness be fair the staff be usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude all in all what you pay be what you get cheap and crap service fast food do right what more can you want a throwback to old timey diners steak and shake be where you get a decent meal at a good price my sisters and i arrive on a tuesday afternoon around 3pm catch their 24 happy hour which we read on the door upon entry a lovely surprise this mean that all shake and drink be 50 off i order the western bbq burger which be 2 thin patties cheese bacon bbq sauce and fry onions it come with shoe string fry my favorite all for the low price of 479 be you kid me whats not to like the food be actually pretty good i like it a lot since it be happy hour i also splurge on a chocolate cover strawberry shake it be meh could have go without it the overpower taste of artificial strawberry really turn me off but the hot fudge save it but how can you really go wrong with hot fudge all in all 3 meals and 3 shake come to 20 a steal also the food be good i enjoy it id come back fast food in a resturant set consider this food be good and cheap plus you can get food to go must be a reason why this place be always pack the food be good unfortunately the service be very hit or miss the main issue seem to be with the kitchen the waiters and waitress be often very apologetic for the long wait and its pretty obvious that some of them avoid the table after take the initial order to avoid hear complaints food be good what youd expect from steak n shake the service be awful so incredibly awful expect to take at least an hour for your meal even when its slow ive be go here for years when i want a cheap meal but the service be so so so awful go to mcdonalds the service be fast but the food be terrible and so be the service i have a bus to catch so i couldnt wait around wait for the check so i go to the counter to pay she never bring my check never check to see if my drink need refill she just mop the floor the burger be really greasy the fry be luke warm and the cheese on them wasnt as flavorful as it should be as a new pittsburgher im not impress i should have know better than to stop here but i be nurse a hangover and just want something quick and simple i should kick myself for think of this place grant i decide to go to the drive thru and know there would be a wait the sign actually say that the food be prepare when you order it i sit for almost ten minutes at the window while my food be prepare during that time i wish i could have take back my order and also wish that i hadnt pay already while sit at the window i decide to just stare inside and watch some of the employees do their job what disturb me the most be watch the employee make the milkshakes make a milkshake isnt that hard or glamorous of a thing to watch what disgust me be that the guy actually lift several of the containers for the milkshakes and smelt them i mean smelt them to see if they be clean instead of actually take the extra minute or two to clean the container after witness this my food be finally ready and i drive away when i finally get to eat my food i be underwhelmed the fry have no flavor and with the size of the cut it appear you get more than what you order the steakburger really they should just call it a burger be overpower by the bbq sauce on it it be all i could taste all this have cement me in not want to ever step foot in one of these establishments ever again burgers be not the best quality better than mcdonalds but not much better the fry be fairly thin but crispy they arent bad the price be also quite decent however their shake be amaze thick and creamy its also great that they have half off shake on weekdays in the early morning like 13am you know what youre get with a steak n shake its about one ring up from a mcds in quality and about two rungs down in quickness at least you think you know i use to have a small place in my heart though the salt and fat werent very kind to say organ for steak n shake because hey who can argue with beef and drinkable ice cream but after my last trip i can think of nothing more disgust than have to eat here this location in particular i havent be back in over year and i will never step foot into a steak n shake as long as i have an immune system that i care about after have eat here i hit the restroom on my way out along with my two friendshey be girls its acceptable one stall be already take so two of us be stick wait while this occupant do hershall we say business after a few second we realize that shes not only there to relieve herself but to also take drivethrough order yes thats rightyou want fry with that flush okay that will be 550 i have never ever witness anything so insane as a drivethrough restroom to top it off after finish her bathroom break she walk straight out of the stall and into the restaurant i guess she be in too much of a rush to complete the order she have just take that she didnt have time to wash her hand and i be in too much of a rush to choke back up what i have just eat before it wreak mayhem on my stomach i love steak n shake this one however leave a lot to be desire the food often come out cold and the servers be apathetic at best most of the time theyre downright rude i highly recommend avoid this location if possible theres one on route 51 thats worth the 15 minutes itll take you to get there i never think that id be give steak n shake a 4 star review but i really enjoy my dinner here tonight it just hit the spot i be impress by our waiter as soon as we walk through the door he apologize for our very brief wait to be seat and for the fact that he be the only waiter work at that time however everything be deliver promptly and he make what wouldve be just a tasty diner dinner into a great experience i order a grill cheese and fry the grill cheese be well cook and fill with tasty perfectly melty cheese i love steak n shake thin and crispy fry and these be as delicious as i have expect for just 9 for me and my husband i have to admit that we have forget how inexpensive steak n shake be base on the cost the food and our fantastic waiter well be back soon i like the occasional steak and shake stop but this one have to be the slowest one ever the cashier be rude and i could hear her yell be you fuck kid me because the register be not work the way she want wow just wow every time we come here the service be laughably bad on this visit a tabe which be sit after us have their food before our server grace us with her surly presence good restaurant elsewhere just avoid this location if you want to get your food inside an hour wow dirty and slow the floor felt like they have the days burger grease spill all over and it take 30 m8n to get our take out order this place teeter between a 2 and a 3 star review ive have pretty good experience inside its usually the drivethru where things fall a part its the rare place i can get a frisco melt well the only place i can get a frisco melt and that steak burger alone be worth the risk walk in or drive thru just take a gun on weekend youll be fine this location be terrible the drivethru workers be rude and they give you crap food i wait 5 minutes before be able to order even when there be only 1 car ahead of me then the lady proceed to ask me if i would like anything on my burger and think the picture on the menu be what theyre suppose to look like and they would never false advertise i ask doesnt it come with the fix like in the picture she then tell me it only come with cheese so i then go on to tell her what i want on my burger pull around and get my order pretty quick but later when i open my burger its just meat and cheese the meat be badly burn and cold it be clear to me this burger be not fresh i didnt even attempt to eat it what a waste of a place they definitely need better workers steak n shake food be pretty good and the price arent bad for the quantity of food i order a grill chicken salad with no dress the salad look throw together and be 549 for 2 croutons tomatoes carrots cabbage lettuce and chicken breast they forget the cheese the staff wasnt very friendly or helpful and seem like they didnt want to be there there usually be a long wait at steak n shake but if you catch them when they arent busy you will breeze through drivethru that be i do like their food and you can eat healthy options but the staff isnt helpful and the quality isnt always there nice staff but apparently there be little manager oversight around 328am i do like this place it must be nice to work somewhere that allow you to choose your own task like smoke sit and texting im fine with cook my food be fourth on the to do list because there be no where else togo really why didnt they answer me at the drive through i think they want me to come inside because my girlfriend and i be really really really good look this be annoy but understandable its okay food be cheap but portion be small for example i order the chicken tender and i get 3 little tiny tender and a decent amount of fry also the restaurant be not really clean either this restaurant be not my number 1 choice as far as im concern filenes basement be good for two things cheap dress and cheap accessories as a young performer i need goodlooking dress for frequent audition and i need a couple so im not wear the same thing every time the dress on the second floor usually range from 3060 and be good for over a year it can be hard to find a fulllength dress thats not reminiscent of a prom dress but their selection of cocktaillength dress be ample as far as accessories go filenes tend to have cheap versions of popular trend if i feel the need to stock my wardrobe with a transient fad filenes be the place to go even when we didnt have a car filenes basement be worth the bus trip to the waterfront i always find something usually i find 34 things and spend about 60 and better still i be always still wear the clothe and shoe 3 months later i kind of suspect this be the best shop in pittsburgh its much better than the usual department store better than marshalls and tj maxx and better than the saks downtown even when it have a sale selection bargain and quality i like this filenes better than gabriel brothers which be harder to get to gabriel brothers be a real discount shoppers challenge and im afraid i didnt live in pittsburgh long enough to develop the necessary skills filenes be still up and run in june 2007 when i leave town love this store dont always have much luck with the sales but i always find something i like here this isnt your average marshalls or tj max i think the green dress im wear be from filenes this be probably my favorite store in pittsburgh for the selection and variety of discount designer clothe other store carry the same stuff but for much much more and its hard to find all the stuff that the basement carry in one spot yes i admit that the burgh have some cool store i would do most of my clothe shop here if i be here more often another store which have go the way of the dodo bird actually there be nothing basement like about it what will be do with the empty space that be the question 975 for a red bull and vodka im sorry i think i be in pittsburgh not new york city sing sing a duel piano bar be fun but it would be a hell of a lot more fun if i could have more than one water down drink before i warble my way through paradise city with the rest of the crowd really enjoy this a lot more than i think i would the drink be on the pricey side but i didnt head here to get smash have a great time at sing sing a while ago with friends friendly staff will return piano man to the tune of gangsters paradisewhat more do i have to say get there early if you want a seat 7 cover and really fun crowd we have sucha great time and i cant wait to go back sing what a blast one of my favorite place to jam on earth cool bar cool town cool people what else do you need the piano players be great funny semigood lookin i mean dude you gotta go love me some sing well the experience do not start well when we walk in the sing we hear be not good oy be it not good thankfully it mostly improve from there so there be 3 piano players rotate out on a half hour basis so each be on for an hour and off for half of the 3 two be really good good singers good piano players and very funny the third guy well not so much piano skills be fine but his sing be not when he sing in his range he wasnt too bad actually but too often he reach for note that he couldnt get to or force things that just werent go to happen often his joke fell completely flat luckily the other two usually do most the talk they play a variety of songs as request by the crowd and would do them in unconventional style if request closer by nin as sing by a lounge singer be a highlight we request britney spear toxic cause we think it would be funny and so they give it a shoot and as luck would have it it turn out really good that take some serious talent to pull off if they didnt know it like toxic theyd find it and play it they play a wide variety of stuff part of the experience be base on the crowd we have a couple larger group there on a thursday night so smallish group in general that they interact with a lot provide some run joke and comedy of course that also mean some annoy drink people feel like they could take over half the show my friends be big fan of the super cheap beer specials 1 draft from rock bottom next door the waitress wasnt great but it could have be that she be the only one there and the layout isnt that easy to navigate the bar be generally uncrowded though so get service there be fast if in the waterfront for a night out definitely a place to hit and have some fun if you be up for some fun and will to sit through a couple clunkers of songsjokes have a fun love group of friends to mock things with when they go off the rail a bite will help make it more fun while we be in pittsburgh for the winter classic on new years day we figure wed see what the area have to offer for nye my wife and i along with my friend and his girlfriend hit up sing sing in homestead its apparently locate on what be the site of one of the largest steel mill in the area when it close they turn the entire site into a large outdoor shop and entertainment development the only remain artifacts from what once be be the nine or so original mill smoke stack still stand at the primary entrance pretty cool sing sing which be a piano bar be attach to the rock bottom brewery and serve a selection of rbbs inhouse brew and share a similar menu there be no tvs no sport memorabilia which be rare for this city and no big booths for large group this place be all about be a cabaret with the focus on the musicians mind you this isnt a bad thing just note that if you want a bar go next door or across the street to dave and busters id say sing sing hold about 150 people seat this particular night they be host a shocker nyes party for 40 buck a person you get a choice of two entrees beef tenderloin tip or lemon chicken veggies mash potatoes one free drink coupon a midnight champagne toast and what turn out to be over four hours of nonstop music again pretty cool there be three musicians hold down the fort play more than just piano drum electric synth bass guitar and apparently i miss the sax there be plenty of crowd involvement as in most piano bar you request songs along with a tip the larger the tip the better chance of hear your song you have i put three request on a sheet with a 10 and manage to get two play their rendition of totos africa be fantastic and surprisingly my curve ball get hit out of the park when one of the guy actually know the tune and word to the theme from tvs grow pain i be sell from that point on i will take this time to note that this be not a family friendly joint im not sure if it be 21 only but i certainly wouldnt bring anyone too young to drive a good amount of sexual refrences and strong language await you drink be stiff and not horribly overprice i think rail mix drink be 700 and beers be 6 or so rbb doesnt brew anything i particularly enjoy so i stick with rum and coke all and all my bill wasnt scary and im not use to that on dec 31st waitress staff be really nice and incredibly attentive no complaints there the only down side to everything be group seat as youre sit at 2top cab table it be easily fix though as the group next to us be up for rearrange table from side to side to front to back allow us to talk and share foodbooze etc also be a tourist we have no idea how hard it would be to get a cab in homestead understandably nye have its issue with cab availability but we have to wait 25 hours for a cab because as we find out homestead be a very suburban community right outside of the city and everyone drive ooops all and all a good time and someplace id certainly return to if for any reason id be back in pittsburgh as long as i have a car in my opinion sing sing be really not worth it it get expensive because you drink maybe start to sing a few lyric drink some more think of a song you wanna hear put 5 and title of say song on a piece of paper you drink they play it everyone else be try to get their songs play so you put 10 on your next sticky noteand so on and so forth i wasnt really into it when i first get there but as the night go on and lager go in i start to warm up to the place i feel that if i have to drink in order to have a good time its not worth it but again thats just me the 2 star be for the piano players who be entertain and very talented and the rock bottom brew they serve somuchfun i wish i could play a song at the drop of a hat too bad i never take piano lessons and id probably end up mumble half the lyric other than the chorus unless its salt n pepas shoop this be a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or be look for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out its just something different to do other than booze it up at the bar on a saturday night keep in mind youll be pay around a 510 cover plus whatever drink and food you get the good thing be the food be come from the attach rock bottom brewery so a lot of it be restaurant quality good plus the brewery beer be actually pretty good of course you will be pay restaurant price drinksso of course theyre up charge a bite but you do pay for the whole experienceso you gotta get into the spirit with some spirit the guy who play be incredibly talented theres 2 guy that will take request and play songs on the piano they pretty much play anything you ask contemporary songs throw back songs fight songs rap songs pop songs you name it they play it my favorite part be when they switch out to another two guy theyll all four get on stage and play two pianos a guitar and drum they usually rock out with some fun familiar songs um journey of course the birthday song be seriously the best they sing to youand call you some nameswith expletives but in a totally nice way of course you just have to go duel piano bar in pittsburgh start at station square and they die out then when the chain restaurant magnet waterfront open in 2000 the parent company of the rock bottom breweries decide to open sing sing in back of the brewery when it first open it be pretty cool the very first house band could put on a show that lead to stand ovations i know i be there from stairway to heaven to free bird stayin alive to shes my cherry pie elton john to the boss they be amaze at sound like the band they be cover equally incredible be the obscure songs that audience members would shout out songs only you though you know and they would effortlessly sing a good portion of the song sound like the band whos song they sing but today sing sing seem like its stick in the early part of the 21st century the whole duel piano shout out a song to stump the band sing us a song youre the piano man have run its course i dont hate sing sing but i could never come here more than once a year its a be there do that kind of place if you want to be wow by musical talent and want to laugh all night go to sing sing if you send a dollar up with a song request they will play it if they dont know it they will ask for the person who put the request in so they can sing something else they like or they will look up the lyric and sing it they aim to please i have definitely be please sing sing be awesome give a buck or more and they will play anything and if they dont know it they will search for who request the song so they can do something else the person will enjoy great humor too what a great time this place be awesome i wish i live right down the road because i could see myself be a regular here honestly these guy have get some talent like real talent they can play the piano sing play guitar and the drum do i mention that they be all pretty hilarious too id easily pay the 7 cover to get in here any day because it really be worth it i be sure i will be back in no time at all next time i be bring a big group of friends come here with a group of girls and didnt have a reservation we pay the cover walk in and it be absolutely pack there be nowhere to even stand one of our friends be have issue with an expire license and when we find out that not all of us get in they let us get our 7 cover back without issue i recently go with a big group who have reserve about 50 seat people who be not in the group keep come in to the reserve area but the staff be very helpful in deal with the group they brew their own beer so do not expect to see any know brand there be only about 6 beers on top so if you be more of a light beer drinker you might not be too happy with the beer choices they also have mix drink and wine the mix drink around about 9 and they have a limit number of bottle win despite what it say on the menu the entertainment be great and i would recommend it for a group out but definitely make sure that you have a reservation this place have go significantly down hill ive go to sing sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years when we start go there you couldnt get a seat unless you get there early it be always pack however each year the crowd seem to get smaller and smaller crowd be an important component of a piano bar due to the interactive nature of it all i be there last saturday night 8412 and there be about 2030 people there very slow and bore it appear the crowd be no longer allow up on stage take a lot of the interactive fun out of what this place use to be this be likely my last time at sing sing save your 7 and skip this place a real shame because this place be once a lot of fun have an absolute blast great for any crowd any occasion any age ashley the waitress be amaze picture billy joels piano man double mix with beer a rowdy crowd and comedy welcome to sing sing a unique musical experience find in homestead if youre look to grab a bite to eat or a beer come on in serve food and brew from rock bottom brewery sing sing keep your tummy full while you listen to two or more amazingly talented pianists take your musical request theyll play anything youd like for tip of course want to hear britney spear toto duran duran yep they play that new or old the crowd make the show so make sure you come ready for a good time if the crowd be dead its harder for the guy to get a reaction if youre want to have some fun it can be a great time its the perfect place for birthday party especially if you want to embarrass a friend the guy will bring them up to the pianos and perform a little ditty for be a good sport you get the covet sing sing bumper sticker now who wouldnt want that duel pianos and brew time to shut up sing sing first time here tonight and i must say i wasnt sure if i want to go it seem like it might be ok but nothing special but i decide to go with friends and man do i have a blast the 7 door charge be great figure u have music from 8 until probably 2 be we leave shortly after 1 the food be not super but good price reasonable the beer leave something to b desire as they r a micro brewery so u can only get their craft i ask for something similar to yeungling but what i get be nothing like it the musicians be great they make this place awesome we will b back and this may b our new pittsburgh hangout go here for the first time this past weekend needle to say ill be return it be a blast it be cheap to get in and since we get there a bite earlier we get a semigood table though it be very annoy that people have reserve table right up front and never show up what be wrong with these people everything if you ask me seriously though if youre go to reserve a table you better freak go i have no complaints about the place itself the guy be hilarious and watch my brother get make fun of multiple time be just the cherry on top anddd this have to be the only place ive ever enjoy be around people who be sloppy drink because the comedians take no prisoners i do enjoy when matt and joey be the ones up there because they be just amaze and make it so much better they be great at what they do cant wait to go back my friend be a piano teacher so i take it as a good sign that sing sing would be quality stuff it be her birthday and i didnt really know anything about duel piano bar i be picture glossy black grand pianos with glitter note pianists in black jacket and crystal glass full of red wine i be really really glad i be wrong it be gritty bawdy and quintessentially pittsburgh first off the pianos be scuff to hell consider the number of tipsy people who sit on them nightly while be mildly humiliate the musicians hammer away at them and theyre cover with n and sing sing stickers its obvious theyve be wellloved the music be anything but the elevator music i be picture its rock hiphop oldies pop and just about any genre imaginable thank to the request system send up a piece of paper with some money and the amaze repertoire of the musicians for instance rubber ducky and gangstas paradise be both feature when i be there and both perform impeccably they also honor a request for a taylor swift song only to receive 30 and a request for anything else which they promptly follow the musicians also do funny versions of popular songs and throw in things like yinz instead of you i saw in awe of the performers for a decent portion of the night it must take a particularly special type of person to put on a show like this consider the energy confidence wit empathy boldness silliness cleverness and sheer talent a job like this require they rotate performers in and out so theres not even an intermission ive read comment about the baseness of the humor but i have no doubt the guy up on stage be intelligent dudes they have great personalities one be about 140 pound cheeky and quickwitted he act out every sport in the winter olympics and be pretty into this 90somethingyearold lady in the audience call joan the other have crazy hair and bright blue chuck beatboxed as well as he sing and make it point to play a handful of songs for my friends birthday i think ray charles be the most soulful guy of all time he say when she request him there be tons of people celebrate birthdays and one big bachelorette party the saturday night i be there the performers bring the birthday boygirl bachelorbachelorette etc on stage for a 20 tip which be pretty easy to scrounge up among friends and humiliate the hell out of them ie this be not the place to be if you cant laugh at yourself my friend have a short dress on when she sit on the piano and they sing a threeminute song about her vagina luckily the show eclipse the bad service and overprice weak drink because those do feature heavily throughout the night the rest of the staff be friendly however and i stumble on the door guy sing and dance by himself which make me smile sing sing be definitely not an every weekend type of thing much like hofbräuhaus but be a splendid way to celebrate a special occasion definitely belong on every require pittsburgh experience list always a good time although its definitely not a place i would visit often its great for groupswhich be quite obvious since there be always several folks there for bachelorette party and birthdays shut out to the piano players who can not only play the piano but also sing play the drum and the sax they be funny and know how to keep a crowd entertain also know some pretty obscure songs my big criticism be the set up if you dont have a reservation andor come later in the even its difficult to get seat believe me i dont mind stand but it do become a bite awkward when you have to keep scoot over to let waitress and patrons past you if you do find a seat it be often litter with someone elses empty glass the musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd so i cant say they be all bad however the minimum for a song request be 5 i spend 20 on a song for my girlfriend and they never play it they be play songs for 5 and 10 but my 40 get me no where even if they didnt know the song which i doubt they could have pick one they know and improvise my tip save your on the request otherwise its fun for special events every once in awhile i go here with a bachelorette party we have reservations which be good because it be pack that saturday night the performers be very talented but the acoustics be strangely off the theme that run through the whole show be to quote some phrase they keep repeat you bitch you slut you whore and twinkle twinkle little slut why dont you take it up the butt which one of the pianists write on the mirror at the back of the stage you get the idea perhaps if i have not be the designate driver alcohol would have make these joke funny the fifth sixth seventh time or maybe not he be incredibly sexisthomophobic he could barely play the piano and when we finally recognize a song we could actually dance to he literally ask me to get off stage because he didnt like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls pretty fun place to go every once in a while but believe me by the end of the night youll be ready to go the show last around 5 hours by the 3 hour mark youll be sick of sit there in the crowd with your 9 a pop drink listen to the same dirty joke over and over and over again my best friend take me to sing sing for my bachelor party i have a blast the musicians duel pianists make fun of me in a bunch of songs they also be really good at play request tune rock when the show be over we shuffle across the hall to the connect rock bottom restaurant for some grub we all have so much fun that we go back for my buddys bachelor party there be some drawbacks though we go on a thursday night so the atmosphere be lack as the place be pretty empty and of course they be a little pushy solicit tip when the place be empty but its not our fault the place be empty on thirsty thursday if their drink werent so damn expensive maybe more people would show up and sometimes they use vulgar language which be just unnecessary since they would have otherwise still be hilarious also there be no table service and the only bartender be a bitch ill probably be back but only for a special occasion when i can afford it i bring my car here in 2006 for repair of a scratch bumper the damage be minimal but the work require remove my entire bumper for repaint the staff be very helpful in explain my options and present me with a few choices to get the most bang for my buck they complete the work in the quote amount of time and do a great job a few weeks later i notice a spot that need touch up and they handle it

time i take my car in for an estimate to a couple months down the line when i get my car repair they still remember me one thing i really like be that they always pick up the phone you wouldnt believe

of course i be expect to be ready by 3 if not before like he say when i express that i definitely need it today he say that he just have to finish this one side and it will be ready by 415 this leave me with barely enough time to get a bus and get over there before they close at 430 honestly if what he have to finish on my car could easily be complete between 350 and 415 i dont think he would bother ask if i still need to have it that day as a result i feel that he may have rush something while put my car back together because now something feel slightly off with the feel of how the cars be align or the way the car drift at time so lucky to be refer to joe diiorios after move to pittsburgh its really invaluable to have car guy that you trust i could detail several experience here in comparison to other chain shop but suffice it to say that theyve always be honest helpful and fair typical but new you see all of the people that be walk in and out and i must say the customers look like they work for a live hear i swear one of the guy be cover head to toe in soot that be amaze run around the store look for those few items that i need to satisfy my need to build and create minimal help from the small quantities of employees but some of them actually ask if i need help after i have find the item when make a customers paymento atlowes we have our checklist 1 do the phone number match nope but thats fine since people be always change their phone number anyways 2 do the name on account match name on check nope but mistake happen at those pesky check company 3 do the account number on the check match the account number on the screen why should it those computers be always make mistake now that we have verify that all the information be correct we can process the payment the customer will be so happy that we didnt have to bother them with any silly question i be sad to say that this be an actual occurrence what be originally an average low have turn into low hell if the associate do not have basic logic comprehension how do they survive would like to give no star buy all new kitchen appliances there refrigerator be defective they send an outside company to repair man arrive with no tool and wrong size seal for freezer not once twice the first time he try to use my spoon from counter to install it i complain too badthey have to comethree time before replace it never again your typical area big box hardware store its convenient to go to because of the proximity to other store and how close it be to so many communities cant really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes its a breeze to run in and then out without have to deal with a single associate this local low serve its purpose for my husband and me a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two i be most impress by the lawn and garden section of the store i be not sure how it compare to other low store but when shop at the home depot in north fayette last fall their flower selection be dismal compare to this low waterfront low beat monroeville low for lawn and garden hate to admit it but its true excellent wing and sandwich generally good food otherwise and fair price nice casual place the service can be a little slow due to how popular the place get at peak time the food here can actually be a little hit and miss but i love the grill cheese club with fry i get it way too much people make fun of me they have a ten dollar minimum for credit card fyi 35 round down its be a while since jb and i eat here and i would consider go back but we just havent get around to it the beer selection look great but the first 3 beers that i want hadnt come in yet they be in the middle of expand their offer this really bother meif you dont have the product dont put it on the menu its not necessarily vegetarian friendly i get a pizza and it be good not fantastic only good justin be satisfy with his meal its a good place to eat if you live in the neighborhood but i wouldnt recommend go out of your way great atmosphere and even better peoplewait staff be very friendly and the french onion soup be amazingdefinetly recommend the home make chip great bar in the up and come homestead areahighly recommend be always look for nonchain restaurants by the waterfront they do exist and this have become a favorite ive have the hot roast beef fry and the corn beef on rye and both be delicious every beer ive have here have be ice cold and the service have be strong too its a great place to watch a pirate game too stop by on a mon even after try to dine at smoke taqueria which be close mondays park on street in front or behind off hay st super friendly bartender in warmer months they have huge outdoor area big screen upstairs cornhole game area okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection try the italian club which be really good two of us split one also try sweet potato fry amazingly good home make chip w bleu be overpower by sauce bathroom be in need of plaster and wall repair be gross out by toilet brushholder on a shelf near toilet at eye level bet its a fun place in warmer months awesome wing and pubgrub great beer selection and fun bartenders this place be overrate a friend and i be look forward to a beer and some good bar food instead the wing be terrible and the beer be good but overprice theres nothing wrong with this place i just dont understand the clout around it there should be no clout theres lot of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place but the food be average at best we be there on a pen playoff night and there be 2 people work all the table in both room our food come to us cold and unimpressive at that our order be somewhat mix up the potato skin use a really cheap artificial cheese that be not very appeal i taste a slice of pizza which be definitely the best thing they offer the crust be delicious and homemade if you be go to order something i would go with the pizza we also order the chicken wing which be pretty good also if you be look for good food homestead better choices at blue dust or tin front before today i probably would have give this place three star base mostly on their beer selection however today the service be terrible we wait two hours for a pizza sub french onion soup fry and buffalo chicken tender about an hour and a half in we finally get the small pizza sub and the wrongly make buffalo chicken tender ie no hot sauce we be tell by the waitress that she realize it be wrong but decide to still bring it out to see if my gf would eat it she send it back by a half hour later we still have not receive the buffalo chicken tender nor the french onion soup which should have be mostly make already and no fry we be tell the chef be new but no effort be make really to make the situation better no quick and easy app or beers on the house to boot the beer be pretty expensive i will probably give the place another chance base on their beer selection but it wont be for a while the food have always be average at best and the pizza sub be no different we end up leave after two hours without receive 75 of our order im read on here that the food be really hit or miss ive only go to dukes one time but the food be good it wasnt too busy so our service be very attentive and it didnt take long to get our food at all the place be separate between a bar area and a more family style din area we sit in the din area because the bar area be pretty full the din room area definitely fill up with an older have live in pittsburgh all their live crowd while the younger crowd be in the bar area ill definitely be back since i live in the area dukethe owneris the man hes a true pittsburgher and he love everyone from pittsburgh he look like hell beat you up but hes a softy with a big heart look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friendshell hook you up hes also totally into the development of other pittsburgh businesses and he host events for local startups ask him for a tour of the old eat n park next doori believe his intention be still to turn it into an incubator of sort fortunately the bar be close enough to the waterfront that its just far enough out of the ghettothe crowd be certainly decent definitely have some beers on the porch in the summerespecially in the rain lower level be cover very relax atmosphere i wish my company be locate in the area so we could frequent dukes more steadily be on the north side still worth the drive to feel at home have a good bite and some cold beers ive be to dukes three time now when i first come to pgh a lot of locals be tell me that this be a good place to catch a game drink some brew and get great food most of that be true but the bad have mostly outweigh the good they have an excellent new tap system last time i go they have thirsty dog leghumpper on draft and it be perfect the system really elevate already awesome beer plus the selection be awesome it be a sportsthemed bar so you can expect drink locals loud tvs and plenty of yell im sort of into that so it doesnt bother me although i do think their staff be not well equip enough to work among the chaos service be often slow and they give the waitress zero train in the beers that they offer this be not a good place for try something new as they cant tell you a thing about it the biggest downfall of dukes though be the food ive have three different but equally simple dish there a burger a cheesesteak and chicken tender the first be flavorless and cold the second be passable but nothing special and the last be absolutely awful honestly the batter and size of the chicken make me so ill i have to call it an early night i eat two of the 7 tender seven and have to quit their fry be very good and so be the wing id say dukes be a good place to drink but thats about it food be good here great beer selection on tap sometimes the beer be on the pricey side what i want from a neighborhood bar be a neighborhood special pinkerton be one of the best sandwich good place to watch football hockey baseball one of my favorite local eateries the mild wild sauce be my absolute favorite i wish i could purchase it i be not a big bar food junkie but the tomlin sandwich be great remind me of a fatheads sandwich food portion be great the only complaint i would have if any be the craft beer be a little on the pricey side as usual in most local bar friendly service will continue to frequent with my family great place for a birthday party a family gather a work retirement party or even a doubledate a combination water hole great place to eat and great entertainment for adults adult game the homestead pittsburgh location of dave busters be just one of the almost 50 locations across the country from new york to florida to california from canada to mexico the dave busters idea be conceive in little rock arkansas back in the 1970s two different businesses one a popular water hole one a game entertainment business be right next door to each other the two young owners be friends and quickly realize that combine their businesses make perfect sense so they open the first combine d b in no not little rock but dallas to this day there be no d bs in little rock not sure what be up with that but lot of other cities have be the beneficiaries of these two friends combine their businesses the one in pittsburgh be the only one i have ever be to when i live there a group of friends and coworkers and me of courseused to go there for happy hour power hour at least once a week we have a blast a great place to kickback and let the worry of the work day melt away wonder if theyll ever open one in marin county ca shuck probably not not a marin county scene for sure what a blast it be though i miss go to d b they have all the classics like billiards shuffleboard plus over 200 interactive video game a rechargable power card provide an easy way to access all the game power hour be game happy hour an entire hour of classic and video game for just ten buck a great bar wonderful food and service a relax and fun way to spend a friday or saturday even youll never want to leave meet your friends here grab a beer and a burger or steak and hit the game time will just evaporate while you laugh and drink with your favorite girl your best friend or even your boss dave busters lot of park lot of fun fun fun fun fun fun fun bring on the beer db be nice once in a while but the food be insanely unhealthy they be also really clever about design the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers you feel a bite milk afterwards also much fatter you pay for game use credit from magstripe card this let db give their game arbitrary price and make it harder for you to really know how much you be spend menus for drink and food have no price 605 for a banana split cocktail 340 for a michelob i have no idea whether that be expensive but not show the price be clever because they can price their things and not have to obey price psychology like anchor and so forth waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts oh and the din room have plastic demo dessert trays to get that think go in your mind as you walk to your table the game be all violent shooters or race game dont appear to have change much since 2002 when i last go to db in california hope they can find more innovative arcade game in the future not a pleasant experience but at least its different from go to an ordinary restaurant this be actually the first time ive ever be to a dave and busters walk into such a huge space especially come from the often narrow venues in san francisco be strange unnerve actually because dave and busters be all about excess almost obscenely so as far as food their stuff be standard most of it be fry and as another reviewer point out not very healthy at all actually you have to really scour the menu to find some somewhat decent viable and nutritious options but most people dont come to dave busters for food they come for the game and while ive never be that into video game or arcade game my brother and sister always have i be apprehensive about have a good time here but after awhile my siblings enthusiasm about the place become contagious and i find myself really enjoy myself especially once i realize that i have mad skills at skee ball and proceed to dominate trust think chuck e cheese for adults skee ball video game pool table clean environment good fun unfortunately i go for a bite to eat and it be impossible to find anything good and healthy on the menu i end up settle for spinach dip sadly they top the dip off with horrible orange shred cheese that appear to have be pop in the microwave for a few second blahhhh try to get something healthy i order the apple pecan salad i swear the dress come right out of the grocery store bottle i could barely eat the salad too sweet my mom order a steak rollholy friedness the steak be more like hamburger fry with cheese and then stuff into bread that be fry again yowzer artery clogger for sure i like the atmosphere i like the bar area perhaps next time well just stop by for drink instead i love the game here but cant go very often since they dont rotate new game in very often the place be usually pretty clean pool table often have a wait on the weekend but be some of the better ones youll find in the city food be just ok drink price be fair but not great dave and busters be an enigma be it din a bar or playground for video game lovers let me get the bar part out of the way first its overprice and they try to get you to buy a glass to jack up your bill next the food just like all the chain place at the waterfront there be sandwich burgers yes they have a blue cheese burger who doesnt pasta salads chicken finger yadda yadda the game i swear over three quarter of the game have be there since 2000 when the place open i guess in ten years no new game have hit the scene overall dave and busters be unique to the waterfront but its time to update the menu update the game and get into the second decade of the 21st century because i have significantly younger sisters i go to dave and busters about twice a year its fun for them and nostalgic for me it can get expensive and the prize be cheap but it make for great sister days as for the food weve eat there once and never again its just blah freeze and fry the veggie burger be put on there as an afterthought just so they could say they offer it a freeze boca patty throw on a bun thank i could have run to costco for that drink be rather expensive but thats to be expect so go for the game fun and laughter and maybe stop somewhere else for drink and a bite to eat skip the bountiful chain that span the waterfront and try blue dust on amity street the food be absolutely gross i order a turkey club which come on a wheat bun with avocado bacon and turkey breast what i get be totally different from the picture first of all the sandwich be on slice bread lame there be no avocado 1 slice of bacon no lettuce and to top it off instead of turkey breast they use freak lunch meat lol no not the kind that you get from the deli the other sweaty nasty look stuff gross our waitress be awful but they be extremely understaffed so i would have a bite of an attitude if i have to wait 10 table without assistance too the manager be really nice of course that disgust sandwich that i didnt eat be free the usual fun center you can play game use a play card which you purchase there game price can be confuse 23 57 99 credit etc the arcade can be fun if you bring some friends almost every game be a ticket game and there be few innovative or excite game choices i didnt eat there so i cant rate the restaurant part of dave and busters we come here on a saturday night and luckily it wasnt as pack as i think it would be i love play ticket game so luckily there be a lot of game to choose from and not many video game sorry video game lovers we only play 20 worth of game and surprisingly we be there for awhile i love their new wheel of fortune game on our first play we end up win a little over 700 ticket they also have fruit ninja as a game it be fun with the big widescreen but unfortunately you dont win as many ticket as you would hope i wish their ticket center would have individual ticket counter like the other dbs ive be to where you fee a count machine your ticket at this place they just weigh your ticket and give you the final count we didnt try the food here and instead go to pf changs to eat before come here but the eat play deal look fun too bad it be only restrict to certain time of the day overall i have a blast here and definitely would come back hopefully next time when there be a deal or promotion a table for 16 please that be what i have to ask for and know that db could accomodate i happen to be in the homestead area for work i really want to dig into my yelp bag of trick provide by local yelpers and introduce my team to the shock and awe they deserve but the shear number would make it hard when i start think about how we would have a manageable lunch the only idea i could come up with be the golden corral i know that be not go to work for me we decide to do something local and walk distance db be it it be what you expect quiet for lunch video game and a bar nearby but i have to forgo any festivities it be a work lunch i be please they have a under 600 calorie menu i be try to maintain a normal diet due to my stretchy pant be out of style and not want to look like a character out of family guy the waitress be very friendly and organize i order the cabo style chicken chicken breast lightly season and chargrilled top with pineapple pico de gallo and serve with spicy rice and steam fresh vegetables it be eh the chicken be cook but the pineapple pico de gallo be bland the rice be bland the vegetables be cold i really blame it on the fact i be with 15 compatriots for lunch so i be give it a fair rat everything be edible my team go with deep fry foods and burgers they seem please service very good food okay not great my meal be 13 ambiance well it be clean but there be not really any people in db there be so many other choices for lunch that be local and close i would definitely recommend another in squirrel hill i suggest you use yelp to find you a better one then come back and play not much of a review for this one but just a few tidbits of info pool on fridaysaturday be 14 per hour im pretty sure its 10 through the week mix drink be way too pricey for the location the food be crap the game be fun and the pool table be nice theyre the big tournament stylesize not the shitty barroom tiny pool table that be all the price be base on my recent trip we shoot pool for a few hours i have a bar tab that wasnt out of control and my night end up cost me 60 i love dave and busters it be a great place to go when you be want to have a great time with a great group of friends if you find you and your friends bore on a friday or saturday night come to db and win some prize it be pricey though so bring some major moolah dave and busters be the best place to eat and play game there be many fun game and prize to win i highly suggest if you want to play game go wednesday when all the game be half off food be pretty good and a nice bar the downside be that the booze be pretty pricey when do dave and busters become a daycare everywhere you look there be sign that say kid must be accompany by an adult but apparently no one be honor that at 6pm on a saturday i couldnt even walk through the place without someone shove me ahhh i get that dave and busters be an arcade and that youre go there to play some game maybe eat and kill some time when i last go there a few years ago we there for my bachelor party and while im sure we get into some shenanigans i dont remember children run wild there we be have adult beverages play game and have a good time this time it be ridiculous it isnt chuck e cheese yet thats how parent seem to be treat the place on top of that the customer service suck the place be gigantic with table and serve areas everywhere yet on a saturday at 6pm the host tell us after interrupt us three time to chat with the other host tell us it would be a three hour wait despite the fact that there be empty table all over the din room i suspect this be a ploy to get you to play game and spend money until youre table be ready but the food at dave and busters be not worth a three hour wait on any day the host tell us we could be serve right away if we go to the midway and find an empty table so we attempt that most of those table be empty with usually one or two adults at a giant empty table fill with coat who inform us that they need the table because their kid would be back soon after play game next i engage in the most rudest thing ive ever do i begin stalk table where people be finish up i would walk up to people pay their check ask if i could have their table when they be do and they would inform me that there be already two or three people who ask them and i should get in line finally we find a table and proceed to spend two hours eat dinner it wasnt because we order a lot of food it be that the waiter take forever to bring our food out he seem to have no problem get us fresh drink until we drink as much as we could and then ask for water after that he seem to come around a lot less i have the build your own chicken tacos which come on a giant plate with all kinds of fix the fix be fresh but the chicken be cold and dry and the tortillas be dry out as well for 14 it wasnt worth it after dinner we proceed to play game which entail shove people to get through areas and wait in line to play anything all in all i didnt like my experience at dave and busters i remember it be a fun place to go and unwind as an adult but between all the kid and the crappy service cant recommend this place if anyone ask me to go back i may elect to stay home and poke my eye with a fork not a cheap night out you will end up spend money here but it be busy fun entertain and a good time out i eat dinner here and the food be great i also play pool and the arcade game my friend and i both have friday off so we decide we want to do something more interest than just hit up a bar on thursday night we settle on dave and busters i go on facebook and print off a coupon for buy 20 get 20 in play free we split the card it take us about 152 hours to get through the game werent quite as fun as i remember but it be still a good time the place be far from crowd and when a machine be out of ticket it take us a good deal of time to find someone to assist us when we do the team at db could not have be more accommodate to apologize for our wait they swipe us in for several game as well as give us a handful of tokens for the game we be play i think a lot of company im look at you american airlines could learn a lot from db it cost them virtually nothing to swipe us in for game but it make our experience so much better drink be halfprice after 8 or 9 my tropical mojito be awesome my friend and i be definitely plan on go back on a wednesday for halfprice game and halfprice drink dave and busters have to be split up into separate experience to rate it din 2 star i have a party of 20 come in i have call ahead of time and arrive early they immediately set up the table while about 4 of my friends and i wait the host after take my name never speak to us again she do not tell us when we could sit how long it would be or any other information and then they make us wait for 75 of our party to show up before they would seat us mind you there be no one else wait and the table be ready and we be ready to order but they didnt tell us this i didnt even know why we be be force to wait until i hear a supervisor whisper to the waitress about make us wait i still have no idea why we be force to wait when my full party be finally seat we be help by two waiters who be perfectly polite and nice but our service be rather haphazard people would order drink and food and get things at wildly different time one person be do eat appetizers and drink when another be just get their first drink i know there be chaos to a big party but it get a little out of hand the food be pretty standard american chain food comparable to applebys and chilis not offensive but nothing to knock your sock off it have a decent selection and a few good desserts and appetizers and everything be competently prepare overall it be a fine enough meal for a large group before go to enjoy the arcade at fairly reasonable price but some of the service standards be poor in the future we will probably eat at one of the other restaurants in the area and then move over to dbs for game bar 1 star drink be predictably expensive but there be a wide variety the problem be that about half of them dont even kind of resemble what be on the menu and most dont have enough alcohol to even taste worse yet while you can get a drink at the bar in the arcade the staff be either completely noninteractive or just rude you have to track them down and then have a minimum of interaction before they stomp off like you ruin their life arcade 4 star there be a lot of great game here to play and many that be fun with group or pair it be a great place for a large party because you can mingle with all your friends play many different very fun game if you be a couple there be also many great selections that everyone enjoy the staff on the floor be helpful and fast to fix game that have problems and be typically polite the ticket prize be cheap as expect but kind of fun and the people in the ticket shop be always nice and quick to help overall 3 star if you want to hang out here i would suggest eat somewhere else and then play game and have fun here but only order beer at the bar and dont expect a smile chuckie cheese for grow upsyeah that could sum up my review for sure but ill try to make it a bite more interest than that first let me say that this isnt my first trip to a dave busters second i actually experience all of it while here we will start with the foodservice staff you be wonderful you be polite you greet us as soon as we walk in the door give us no qualms while order and be swift with your delivery food you be not wonderful i order the bbq chicken breast this come with a side of broccoli and their type of mash potatoes the chicken be a bite dry and in some place you can tell it be leave on the grill a little too long there be actually some bite that all i could taste be char meat there wasnt enough bbq sauce on the the chicken either the broccoli appear to have be cook prior and then throw back into a pan to be sear some of my broccoli actually have some burn crisp areas on it also i notice that there be still some leave leave on the broccoli the mash potatoes i want to like which i hop would be the best part of the dish im a bite of a potato freak but alas i be let down sad face they be cold and such a tiny portion with a tiny amount of shred cheese and bacon but into that divot they make with the scoop to get it out of its container oh food how if i didnt need you to survive i wouldnt complain about you the build right now be in disarray they be in the midst of a remodel with lovely plastic curtain cover up certain section of their din area no bar out in the din area right now and the pool table be absent as well if you want a drink you have to go back into the game room speak of the game room by far the best part with the meal i order i get the 20 play card the best part of the meal super charge it for 3 more and its even better the game room you can tell be in need of an update the carpet be wear and other sign of wear be noticeable as well one good thing be the game they change them up so often that there be always something new once you return who know that play connect 4 could be so fun or for that matter skee ball rise to the top of my list to play i will return again but only after i eat elsewhere first not really sure what to add so ill bullet point my experience expensive poorly make drink friendly but slow service ok food consider have the philly steak and cheese over run with kid before 10 that seem to have zero adult supervision 15 of the game be out of order air hockey big bball game 12 of the skee ball random other arcade machine expensive game fun time overall with the wife mediocre service cold food our food wait so long the lettuce pickle wilt bland food crazy overprice long wait in the arcade 1 beer per hour maximum avoid at all cost fair manager not be from the area i travel an hour to come here from uniontown pa i be excite i havent be to this dave and busters since i be younger and be ready to go back and play me some game i go with my cousins mind you we hadnt eat all day and be very hungry so we decide to do the eat play combo naturally heres where it get bad first of all we get a very snobby host that show us to our table then we waitand waitand finally after about 25 mins we get a waitress her name be ashley we have plenty of time to decide what we want so we quickly put our order in next we be sit and talk wait we have empty glass and our waitress have never even come around to see if we need refill except for one time she say shed come back right away with our refillsyea right 20 mins later we get our refill mind you our food still hasnt come yet i see other people get their food that have come in after us i be frustrate after wait 45 mins for our food i ask to speak with a manager one of the servers who i ask reply rudely with well hes really busy right now i doubt hell be able to come out and talk to you finally 15 mins laterthats one hour folks we get our food what do you think the next problem be yep the food be cold i be completely feed up at this point and tell my waitress how disappoint i be especially after drive one hour just to have this terrible service the manager never come to speak with me and we didnt even receive our meals for free the only compensation we get be 10 game card wooptydoo the only thing good about this place be the game but the prize you get for your ticket be all junk and worthless so in conclusioni do not recommend the waterfront dave and busters of homestead pa it be horrible and i will not be return for a very long time this place just plain suck bad management lose them biz dumb arcade drama they have recently change their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite have a guardian over 30 years old i have fun here fun big kid game for me o but the bartender melissa be a super bitch and rude hope they fire her first time at dave busters and although i didnt go for the game i be slightly disappoint i go with a group of girls for dinner and drink the service be slow but the food be decent the portion be huge but they be price slightly higher than the average chain we go before 9 pm and there be a ton of kid there on a friday night i do suggest if you want to avoid the children to go after 9 dave busters its a nice place to eat have fun and drink all age can enjoy this place i be so excite to hear them announce that after 10p all children whether accompany by a guardian or not have to go it make for a nice even for adults only everytime we go whether we play or not we enjoy ourselves i didnt give it four star because every time ive go i havent be able to eat in the restaurant area of there i know i still get the same food that everyone else do wherever you sit sometimes i like the nice relax atmosphere of the restaurant i havent as of yet be seat there not to mention that the servers around the bar be a little slow at respond to customers as well so all in all dbs be a good spot to stop at for food and entertainment just dont expect to be seat in the restaurant portion and expect to wait awhile for food service in the bar area be impress by the new menu and new decor our waitress be nice knowledgeable and attentive however the rest of the staff be less than stellar there be a power outage less than one minute while we be pay game sunny and calm outside so not sure what happen my family and i be play a trivia gamewe lose about ten dollars of credit and all our bonus ticket when the power resume the game be down for about 20 mins after the outage and staff be not friendly when we inquire about what happen or when the game would be work again after the outage two people in our group could not get their power card to work when we ask staff for assistance they just brush us off and say we must have be out of credit kinda a bummer we lose so much money on malfunction game play tonight visit from toronto i be really impress the amount of ticket to be win be incredible we usually get 200 ticket per play on average compare to playdium here thats awesome consider id win at most 10 ticket with the smallest prize cost 100 ticket the food be great the place be clean and the game dont feel greasy or nasty from all the food a fun place and lot to do but a bite pricy 2000 will buy you a hundred point which will last you a little over an houri recommend the bowl game ball race car game and connect 4 also there be several game that can be play in group of 4 visit the dave and busters in homestead pa last night waitress mix up our credit card and give my brothers credit card to someone else and he theirs charge them already too both incorrectly my brother have to walk around and find out who it be waitress never apologize gm be extremely rude and refuse to give my brother his original receipt back say they have throw it out do nothing to remedy the situation and ignore us the rest of our visit not even a refill after spend over 300 plus game we will never go back whatever happen to the customer be always right horrible service i love it love it my boyfriend and i be in our 20s and have visit this db multiple time after our visit yesterday however i dont think well be back when we arrive we be greet by a long line of people wait to buy game card at first there be 2 extremely slow workers try to do this then one leave while the line be still out the door the girl that be leave be more than incompetent and be take extremely long to fill these game card we stand in line for over 20 minutes before be tell that there be another attendant in the actual game room needle to say the line in the game room be just as long and they still only have one girl in the booth it be a saturday after we finally get our card we have to wait yet again to get a beer 2 bartenders on staff while the bar be completely full it take us almost an hour before we actually could start game the floor be filthy with trash and the bathrooms repulsive i have to use the restrooms twice during our visit and not only do both bathrooms i use have no toilet paper in them but there be tp all over the floor and the sink be less than cleanly my boyfriend mention that the guy restroom be no better as it smell like pee and the paper towel dispenser didnt work all i have to say be get your crap together we could see a difference in the type of crow that be there on saturday compare to what it use to be and im i have no doubt its due to the poor service and attention to cleanliness for how expensive they be they need to staff better on weekend its a shame how quickly this place have go down hill and we will not be return anytime soon most of the game be out of order and i have to find one of those referee look people to fix 2 of them that take some of our credit apathetic service staff all around the peanut and i be really disappoint wont be back ehh 35 i cant rate it super low because i do smile a lot during my visit speak of that ive be here a few time but never write a review for db im a kid at heart and honestly do enjoy the game however there have be multiple instance where i swipe my game card it take my credit but no game begin there have also be time that i win and no ticket be release i guess nothing be perfect but it do happen atleast once a visit each scenerio its hard to find a worker walk around and for halfprice game you kind of just take your loss with the 13 credit for skee ball hmph the food it really isnt anything too fancy ive have okay food but super long wait time for a simple chicken finger fry for example its your basic sandwich salads appetizers a few pastas i believe all sandwich burgers be around 10 serve with fry you can get the eat play deal which include food from a specific menu a game card besides the game card deal if you want to make db a date night you might be better off head to another place to eat in waterfront for amaze food but to each their own try it once i suppose the brownie sundae that i devour last night be satisfy 2 brownies 2 scoop of ice cream one with chocolate syrup the other with raspberry sauce fresh strawberries oh whip cream drink pretty weak we order 2 liquid maryjanes 2 each that be which be fill with multiple shots of alchy didnt really catch a buzz oh welllll they do have a happy hour from 57pm id go during that time for the best deal i believe cocktails be half off 3 off bottle of wine ive never see anyone walk around with a wine glass though lol the prize as others have note the prize be a little cheap for the amount of ticket they cost however its cool to leave with a db coffee mug cup or shoot glass last night for 2500 ticket we decide on magneticstyle dart board 1300 a coffee mug a db glass our plastic one bite the dust a db coffee travel mug i might be miss a few odds end overall its a fun time but can be pricey its best to head here wednesday for half price game or get the eat play deal while din i cant lie though i find myself smile ear to ear a few time within those 3 hours woah seem longer than amount of time d speak of which in that timeframe we play 250 credit cost 40 but it be halfprice game dave busters be a great experience if you set your expectations realistically and carefully choose when you attend the main squeeze and i always 1 use a survey receipt for buy 10 get 10 in free gameplay or 2 attend on a wednesday during the day flexible work schedule wed never dream of eat there because we like healthy yuppie food and we only drink cheap draft or drink cocktails during happy hour your visit be largely determine by time of day expectations and whether or not you eat their food if you come on a friday night the line will be long youll pay 150 for the two of you to eat drink and play for 3 hours and youll be leave with a very sour taste in your mouth the staff be really excellent any issue with a game not pay out ticket result in immediate help and extra ticket or a swipe for a different game from an employee note the drink be weak review also notice it be people buy shots and order multiple drink per person thats typical white trash behavior bartenders here be savvy they mirror the behavior of the guests all of our drink have be consistently strong and well put together because be courteous and tip well i have witness bartenders bypass tattoo loud guests and address me and take my order first this be rational logical behavior also note the prize center game suck comment youre suppose to stack ticket over multiple visit and use them on a big prize like life delay gratification net you bigger return every other visit ive see someone walk out with a video game system wii xbox360 and even a few xbox ones the thing about dave busters be the crowd change depend on day of week and time of day sunday afternoon its all families and friday and saturday night its all drink 20 somethings the atmosphere change and thats why the review be all over the place this review be base on 8ish months of 13monthly visit most visit be 5 star some be 4 star use survey receipt for buy ten get ten avoid wednesday friday or saturday even and sunday afternoon families and avoid the food entirely and drink cheaply youll have a great experience for 2540person i really enjoy the staff too they split the difference between fun and professional special shout out to riley give us info on possibly host a party there to keep it short and sweet save yourself 100 buy a good board game your alcohol of choice order a pizza and invite your friends over what an incredible disappointment after see the entice commercials so many time we decide to give this place a try on a double date i understand the price of the play card and wont dispute them however the food be incredibly overprice come out cold as in sit on a counter without warmers for a minimum of 30 minutes and i literally have to ask the bartender if there be any vodka in my drink it be pure juice 38 for three shots that have littleno alcohol in them not to mention my glass be dirty and i saw the bartender scoop the glass into the ice basin because she be too lazy to use the sanitary scoop i know the food and beverage commission would be as disappoint as i be the service be terrible dont ask for anything from your waiter as they be a little too busy on their cell phone or converse amongst themselves be it fun to be in an adultthemed arcade yes if youre look for a good atmosphere to go with friends to play game i suppose i would advise you give it a shoot i would never recommend their food customer service or drink save yourself the money and stay home or go for a traditional bowl figure skate rollerblade rock climb basically any other physicallyentertaining theme date instead i still love this place i spend my 36th birthday at dbs and it be a wise decision i have so much fun and so do my guest i get a very attentive serve staff and meet up with many helpful servers i believe that service have improve so i bump this restuarant up to 4 star no five star yet because ive still as of yet to eat in the restuarant portion of it its still worth the visit and be a lot of fun for a reasonable price there be good food but a great spot to enjoy a few drink watch sport on the big screen its great for adult fun after 10pm great for a first date if you like to have a good fun feel relax my wife and i go here around 10pm on a saturday night the food be not spectacular about the same quality that youd get at an applebees or some place similar good but not great my steak be tough but my wife enjoy hers staff be relatively unorganized we eat at a table next to the bar and have to wait awhile for a server food be prompt after have a few less than memorable trip to db in years past my wife and i decide to go back for a pittsburgh happy hour anniversary party this past thursday pgh happy hour be a facebook group of friends that like to check out new water hole every thursday and its run by a guy that seem to party 247 while still hold down a very lucrative full time job anyway pgh hh be celebrate an anniversary and choose db for the location the db staff set up the back pool room with complimentary enormous spread of appetizers with dip and keep refill them when they get low our server carla be very attentive and friendly make sure we be aware of the specials and check back often when our glass get to the half way point the other server back there be work equally as hard but i never get the chance to get her name i have be here one other time for an organize happy hour for a past employer and remember very similar service but i never get the chance to give them any credit i think db be an awesome place when you need some space for your next event ok let me tell you about my bad experience first i go to db last night for a post wed party which side note be a great idea it be around midnight and the bar wasnt really populate there be three bartenders and only one be actually make round to see if anyone need anything the two other bartenders be chat on the far side of the bar that no one be sit at kind of counter productive if you ask me i stand there for about 5 minutes which for a busy bar be fine but when i be the only one with my card out then it just seem a little ridiculous i make eye contact with the one girl twice and give her a smile and she literally turn away i finally have to walk to them to get their attention i be stand right in front of them smile and they didnt ask if i need anything i finally say be you work and they give each other a weird look i felt like i be the crazy one i ask for a beergot the beer in between that time the other bartender bring food over and set it down she take a fry from the plate right in front of me and then serve it to someone on the other side of the bar what the hell i felt like i be in some grimy bar in out in the stick not an establish db i be just really turn off from that experience the good be that db provide a different type of entertainment when you want to mix things up i remember go here with my grandparents when i be a kid and it be the best treat ever we would eat at the restaurant and then spend hours play game this place hold some really good memories for me its a shame that my experience last night have spoil the high standards i hold for it its fun but much smaller than some of the others ive visit its clean staff be friendly and its a good way to waste time before a movie they do have good food get a 3 star because i get bore easily at this location i use to love db when it first open in the waterfront but it have go down hill over the years the game be not as fun and do not give you as many ticket and the prize have get cheaper in quality it take a whole heck of a lot of ticket for you to even get a pencil the atmosphere be okay but it use to be so much better with the funnest game and diverse group of people now it be run down and many of the game be app relate game fruit ninja and 3d experience rid with such game you cant even earn ticket and they take a lot of tokens last time i go back in the winter many of the game be break which make for a negative player experience i would go to db to play some game again in the future but it be no longer one of my favorite place to go due to the decline of fun game where you can earn ticket i be here on 103 and i have to say this be a horrible experience me and a friend go here to eat and play a couple game afterwards it take the waitress at least 1015 minutes to greet us and by that time we know we should just order then because we might not see her again we order and get our drink and well let just say we didnt see the waitress again until she be give us our check some manager deliver the food to the table no refill on my beverage no how be your food no ketchup for my burger or fry be offer lot of people run around like crazy and if your understaffed hire more people i will not be back again to eat ill have a bias opinion of any place like this what could be wrong with play old and new school game drink and eat all at the same place the one thing i can think of be the price on the surface this be a pretty expensive place however they give a bunch of good deal depend on the time you go whether or not you donate money to the makeawish foundation and if youre lucky when you take a spin on the wheel of prize but honestly know what the deal be before you go to make sure to get the best price available in regard to the game theres a plethora for your enjoyment although it be nice to play game that spit out ticket the last couple of time ive go ive get 2 hours of arcade game for a very cheap price mario kart anyone either way its a really fun place that youll most certainly have a good time at first off let me say that i find the people who usually work at dave and busters usually dont care or seem to be angry and hate their job a friend and i go here and find that a couple of the machine run out ticket and someone be always there and happy to help the staff go out of their way to make sure we have a good time the manager tony be very sweet and make sure everything be ok every staff member we talk to be extremely nice this be by far the best dave and busters ive have be to my sister and law want to go here for lunch so all the kid could play game after we all have some lunch together this place be huge and be moderately clean except the bathrooms all of the food look great on the 16 page menu when our food come though everything be below average they have a huge selection of game for the kid to play but you pay dearly to play game here the food be overprice and the drink be drastically overprice rock bottom brewery in homestead be always a good time they brew their own semimicro brew here and generally have as many as eight brew to choose from saturday night c and i stop by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages our first issue of the night be get to rock bottom as the restaurant be locate in homestead a trip across the hi level bridge be in order little do we realize that the bridge be under construction and it take nearly 40 minutes to get across it upon arrive at the restaurant we be present with the task of find a place to park which prove to be a daunt task this place be absolutely pack due to several locations share a park lot after we get inside our wait be about 45 minutes but luckily we be able to find a seat inside the pack bar while we wait the food at rock bottom be quite tasty but it be all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers lead their menu they also have entrees such as steaks but this place be not exactly know for their high class food products i be pleasantly surprise by the quality of the food and we quickly determine that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar our order consist of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu include chicken nachos quesadillas and ball park pretzels we have plan on split a meal for dinner but by the time the appetizers arrive we know we have way too much food in front of us the nachos be on a gigantic plate and pile high with cheese sour cream guacamole and shred chicken contain just the right amount of jalapenos they have a nice little kick as well in much the same way the quesadilla be much more than an appetizer portion with shred meats and cheese overflow from the tortilla there be enough food here for a two person entree the ball park pretzels be the reason we come to this place they be always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt as far as the beers be concern i order up the sampler so that i could get a taste of the various brew they make a wide assortment of brew from the bud lightesque lumpy dog to a dark brew master choice i find many of the beers to be quite tasty however nothing exactly special about them i would be that a taste test would find one hard press to choose the rock bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack dont get me wrong still excellent brew but i would expect more from a place that claim to be a brewery i give it 3 out of 5 rinsems due to the lack of originality in the brew and the amount of traffic involve with get in and out of the place horrible beer horrible service horrible menu summary if i be in the area and no one have a better suggestion for where to go i might come back for beer and appetizers good decent beer original pretzel appetizer you take chunk of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip huge portion most of us have leftovers the rb appetizer sampler be multistory and way more food that we could handle the half order of rib look like a full rack attentive service with quick seat and frequent drinkwater refill amuse name bad lot of food choices burgers steak chicken salads lot of drink choices beers win mix drink i guess this could be see as good but it take a while for everyone to pick something and since no ones awesome at everything you could tell right away that nothing distinguish this place none of the food be super awesome nothing be awful but nothing stand out in any way ive have better beer appetizers and a better main course at plenty of breweries kind of dead on a monday night with 34 of the place empty come if you want bar food but keep your expectations low i be a big fan of rock bottom there be several dish that be money appetizer sear ahi spinach artichoke dip entree fire steak pub tip or chicken fry chicken desert carrot cake to die for bar food pizza or ball park pretzels both of which be spray with brown ale half the menu be really good the other half be great the beer be good ask for the sampler they usually have a velvet and something on cask ask for one of those if you be look for something different they will also have a scotch ale an ipa whiskey stout or other specialty depend on the mood of the brewer which if its still matt the mood be grumpy if andy be still work there he be sure to please and molly be great in the cocktail area head over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrap i use to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can dont go to the one in charlotte though its not really a rock bottom i think this place be pretty decent my friend and i be both still reel from thanksgiving dinner so we order salads and they be huge and tasty i like my salad though it be slather in way too much dress my friends be even more slather so she didnt dig it too much wed also order chip with guacamole the guac be pretty good my friend enjoy her beer i enjoy my coke i know im lame so yeah wasnt bad wasnt the best but it be okay microbrewed beers be only a plus to me when theyre better than the beer i would have drink otherwise one waitress i have while there try to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describe one of their beers as kind of like coors light if i want coors ill pay half as much and have one the food be actually a save grace as it be pretty good head next door to sing sing for drink though not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst i like the food and i have try all the beers theyre just ok as far as beer go large portion friendly staff my friends get everyhing from steakthey didnt even get a well do steak right to mahi tacos and the only great menu item be the season vegetables give it a miss sing sing next door be awesome but get dinner somewere else after we be do the waiter ask if we be ready for the check and i have order meal that come with a desert really dissapointing all around everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and ive never be dissappointed i sit in the bar grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos the bar have a pool table and plenty of flatscreens rock bottom be a chain but its one of the better chain in the area ill pass on chilis or fridays and come to rock bottom instead oh and typically i walk over to target work off some of those nachos nobody have review this in a while but i be surprise at the lack of lovin my husband and i eat here a few nights ago and we like it a lot we start with drinkshe get the housebrewed portland wheat and say it be quite a good beer and i get a mix drink red rock that be also tasty he get a burger cover in mozzarella cheese and i get a mahi sandwich both greatthe fry and side salads be good here too and there be no skimp on portion of anything there be tons of things on the menu that im look forward to try we be usually not dessert people at all but end the meal share a triple chocolate stout cheesecakewho can resist a beer cheesecake come on our food and service be great they have the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and be set up live music for after the game seriously whats not to like im think this place have change for the better since the last review a year ago this be literally the first place i go when i first come to pittsburgh and i love it hearty fullsized meals lot to choose from and not too crowd or noisy although for the sake of full disclosure i didnt sit at the bar and i dont drink alcohol so i cant comment on that i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom end up be a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night really i have no complaints about this place so im surprise by the few low rat here little slow on the service and didnt have the beer i want on the menu but you get those things when they brew their own beers onsite but the stadium pretzels be good the cream stout be tasty the burgers be good and big with the little skinny fry im not a fan of the skinny fry but hey the burgers would choke a horse and almost do o lately the rock bottom be hit or miss the beers be always good and the uppity jagoff ipa be one of the best india pale ales ive ever taste the low point lately have be the food i will never forgive the idiot in management who take the chicken quesadilla off the menu that say i order the lobster roll and when it arrive the bread be as hard as a brick and cold the fill be okay but the lobster flavor be mask by over spice i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom pretty good excellent beer sampler bargain veggie burger awesome onion ring awesome fry mac n cheese be delicious crunchy on the outside creamy on the inside carrot cake be monstrously huge and delicious first off i will say that i just move here from california and be a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach i come to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location now rockbottom be a chain brewery so a lot be the same the menu the food price yet beer be cheaper and i be fine with that i have always find their food to be pricey but they use excellent ingredients and it have always be tasty and fill so i be fine with that the food here be just as good as the long beach location so i have no problem with the chef at all service be good our waitress be very friendly and helpful i wish that they have ask us if we want to sit in the bar since happy hour be still go but that isnt a big thing go to the bar to get a drink and have to wait awhile to get the bartenders attention but he be very friendly and i get a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learn i have just move here i really enjoy that beer we get the beer sampler to try the whole list and well i find the dark beers a bite lack in comparison the light beer and the wheat be amaze very impress the pale be ok as be the velvet pale that be one of the specials of the night but both be way too citrusy the uppity ipa be very good i dont usually like ipas because the hop overpower all flavor but the brewer have a good balance still couldnt do a whole glass i felt the imperial stout have a bitter burn taste that be overpower i almost want to say the batch have too much chocolate malt in it not ice cream malt for the nonhomebrewers the brown and amber be decent but bland i end up get an actual glass of the light beer and be able to finish it all without force it one point up on long beach who have a good light but the aftertaste get to you before the glass be empty i really want to try the das gut dopplebock but they be out look like they will have it in bottle to go soon so i hope i can catch that also want to try the snow moon belgian verdict while i be not too impress with the dark beers i find the lighter ones very good and i look forward to try the other seasonal beers it be a good hour drive south to get there so i wont be go too often but i will be back even since rock bottom open 7 years ago i have always think it be a dance club i be not really sure why but i think it be along the same line as throw back hitops but i do i think i always think this place be a club because of the behemoth size of the space well i be out with a friend and we need a place to go before a show at the improv and rock bottom be close part of this be my faulti always order healthy items at place that specialize be greasy bar foodthen i be upset when the meal isnt 5 star i start off with one of their wheat beers it be alright i nurse it all through dinner so i dont think i be head over heel in love with it i get the catch of the day off the hook fish dish sailors delight or somethingi forget it have some cheesy fish theme name it be cod meh that should have be the sign not to get it with roast asparagus and lemon rice the fish be suppose to be broil but it have a thick bread annoy and the portion of fish be tiny the rice and asparagus be great though my friend get a chicken sandwich which he enjoy although the fry be pathetic the fry be probably precut freeze fry or just very poorly execute they be so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor pros a lot of table no wait brew special beers big menu could hear the duel piano bar next door con place be fairly empty and we get a crappy table by the door when it be 5 degrees outside most of the food be fry cheese fill cream base or wrap in bacon i know some people love to eat food like this all the time i do every once in awhile but if you eat out a lot you cant always get the spin dip burger and ice cream sundae i would love to but its just not in my card i do like like when causal place offer some healthy options go with a group after work for dinner and a brew we order a few appetizers first the wing be good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip be fun have a burger you can create your own from veggie turkey or fresh grind beef have a fresh grind beef and the meat be fresh and cook perfectly with a fresh bun the brew pub be nice and be surprise it wasnt busier heres the trick to enjoy a meal at rock bottom dont get fancy with your food order stick with the sandwich salads burgers and bar food and youll be ok ive have bad experience will all the fish dish include the fish and chip also ive find the service be generally better in the bar area than the dinner area join the mug club even if you dont go often and rack up point for free mug and beers thursdays be trivia nights and the dj be play the music loud so go if you dont really want to have a conversation with the person youre with beer selection be good but they be out of the ones we want 4 of the 6 people in our group order steaks all of them be cook to their satisfaction the bourbanzola be a good addition defiantly a place i would go again joe our server be awesome and super friendly i love this place great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go rock bottom be a nice hangout place often when you be out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from scream over all of the background noise great if your out to see a band but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sit around you depend on your mood you can sit in the din area full of booths and table its alittle separate from the main bar area so provide for a semi quiet din area the bar area give you a choice of sit at the surround table with waitress service or hang out at the bar itself complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brew cold and the ever entertain company of your favorite bartender when the weather cooperate the outdoor patio house about 6 table for outdoor din the view howevernot so picturesque just the entrance to the improv which hey that could be the perfect seat if youre stock the local comics the bar area contain pool table and dart board to try your skills on any give night sport fan can enjoy the game of the day on one of the 6 big screen tvs surround the bar area the menu be pretty decent with burgers that be cook to order with the choice of either steak veggie or chicken they have a number of specialty burgers with different cheese toppings and creative theme the bourbonzolla be a tasty burger with a bourbon base glaze and gorgonzola cheese appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp steaks pasta and salads with rotate specials from different areas of the menu on monday the burgers be half offi dont think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special however if you be here regularly the mug club be great with free gift and specials httpwwwrockbottomcommc needle to say i have a fun beer glass collection thank to rock bottomlol now everyone favorite part about rock bottom beers the in house brew master keep it interest with a rotate variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of ale ipas rotate darks and kolsch stop by on thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where team battle it out in a game of intelligence and drink skills weve all have this happen to us you go past a place one hundred time and never go on then once you finally do you realize how many opportunities you waste rock bottom be definitely a solid bar as a microbrewery their beer list be full of house brew there be better beers in the world but there be a lot of worse beers out there too what really make rock bottom standout though be the food my girlfriend and i share an order of nachos and it take everything we have to finish them they also make a mean soft pretzel the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh but no trip to the waterfront be complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom i would have to say im pretty partial to rock bottom i have be go almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic team trivia my friends and i love the atmosphere the dj todd and the service that we get at rock bottom every week when we go a menu be never need because we pretty much know everything we want on it except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new as an avid rock bottomer hand down i have never in my life have a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have have here at rock bottom whether i have eat dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant my favorite and my food of choice be the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip it be a meal itself the mixture of onions cheese spinach and tomatoes be perfection another favorite of mine be the barbecue chicken pizza it have a great kick to it and its big enough for two people the service have always be super great and now since we go often we have develop a great relationship with some of the wait staff a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm rock bottom on thursday nights be the place to be team trivia start at 8pm and it be free to play the dj todd be great the food be good but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip be the best the wait staff be generally pleasant and on top of things a few servers be excellent i be not a beer drink so i havent try the microbrews but the mix drink ive have have be good and a few of thier specials perfect on nights that be not trivia nights rock bottom be quiet and a good place for a small to medium party larger party will usually be split into two table overall an enjoyable place at which i be a regular so i have not be to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since i be with colleagues on travel for work and they choose this place i go along first surprise decent beer i remember the normal rb brewery beers be not much to write home about but they have a couple of new style include a very good imperial ipa that for 5glass cannot be beat second surprise pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expect recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna both be great service be a little slow not sure why so a 4star review be downgrade to 35 ill be back next time im in pittsburgh for work the beer be good their light beer lumpy dog be very good doesnt taste like a light beer when i be pregnant i become quite a fan of their root beer float too as others have note the pretzels be really good im not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband like it veggie burgers be always good too though the staff sometimes seem confuse when you order say the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger long long ago when i use to go to the rock bottom in boston there be a hot mushroom sundried tomato cheese dip on the menu that be fantastic if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star i always feel like i be constantly bash breweries for their food but in my opinion i feel the bar be raise for place like this it seem there be so many breweries out there that offer great beer and slack off on the food unfortunately rock bottom be one that fall into that category let be honest when you go to a brewery you want the full experience if it be only about the beer id go buy a growler and take it home so about the beerexcellent the jagoff ipa be with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever have they only i can think of that i think be better be dogfish head but thats a matter of opinion the beer selection be constantly change and they always have some excellent seasonal beers you cant go wrong theres bind to be a beer everyone will like as for the foodits pretty much a crap shoot sometimes its good sometimes its terrible my biggest problem be there be absolutely no consistency when it come to the food one time its perfect then maybe its cold or its burn or it taste completely different from the last time you have it unfortunately it seem there be zero attention to food quality thats pretty much it this place fix its food consistency and its a five star place till then its hit or miss i be so ready to like this place turn out not so much it be okay no better than tgifridays but better than eat n park the deets the hubster and i be here on a saturday even after a show at the improv so we be happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eat we order drink he a wheat beer of their brew me my fave bloody mary with absolut peppar the hubster deem the beer acceptable but wouldnt go out of his way to come back just for another oneyes he do order another one just to be sure my bloody suck water down tomato juice with no discernible peppar of any kind let alone any other season even a good standard mix would have be better our very efficient and friendly waitress take it back and watch while it be remake by the other bartender nope no better at all that go back and i go with a youcantscrewitup amaretto sour it be fine hub order a reuben why ill never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what use to be at the longlamented gazebo in shadyside you younguns wouldnt have a clue of the establishment of which i speak he say this one be fine i have the texas fire steak with jalapeno butter which i enjoy very much pack a punch of heat and flavor but the side be uninspired steam veggies any flavor be steam out in the process eh cheddar mash potatoes there be cheddar in there no way the tab be reasonable we do have a live social deal that take 30 off so our check be for 12 and change not include tip not bad even with the 15 cost of the ls deal but have we pay full price it wouldnt have be worth the experience well hit the improv again we have before but well head somewhere else afterwards i must admit i do like the brew i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes other than that meh the food be pretty forgettable another brewery that sadly fail to be anything special in the food department with the restaurants up the ante on 8th ave you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom but how would anyone know to its a chain whomp whomp for a brewery who be attempt to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mash potatoes sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not be to germany not worth 595 unfortunately the sausage platter be 1595 din in twice food ok atmosphere good ive always be pleasantly surprise with the food ive get at rock bottom i say surprise because with any restaurant that fall into the slippery territory of a chain you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds but ive really have a lot of good meals at rock bottom now grant you do owe it to yourself when order to not forget where you be a barstraunt if you will and dont get anything above and beyond this place call of duty for instance i will never be order the ahi tuna ill leave that to my favorite sushi bar and restaurants a bite closer to the water the mon doesnt count but besides that i always really enjoy my meal choices ive recently get the chicken avocado sandwich chicken be grill perfectly plenty of avocado and it be a good size sandwich without be excessive ive also order the margherita pizza which could definitely be split between two people its an eight cut that come to you on a big wooden pizza paddle the pizza be really great the crust be crispy it have a good balance of cheese and tomatoes and the basil pesto be fresh and tasty and not greasy whatsoever big bonus point there but my biggest surprise as of late be when i order their chicken flautas im a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of be disappoint but i have an insatiable crave one night and decide to go for it it be delicious the flautas be deep fry which give you an amaze crunch and they still manage to not dry out the inner ingredients the accompany rice be nice and moist as well i be so happy ive always be quite happy with the service there as well i go on thursday even for trivia and nine time out of ten the service be really spot on the ladies service the bar area be friendly and attentive only once or twice to my memory have my service be subpar and that can usually be chalk up to an extremely pack trivia night with only two visible servers help 50 people i definitely give rock bottom two thumb up for take your typical chainfound food and make it fresh yummy and worth come back for more i go to rock bottom this past weekend and it be nice to see that nothing have change in the year or two since my last visit while the beer be pretty good it have never outweigh the fact that the service isnt good and the food be average at best it be even difficult to get beers at the barwe try to have the girls order think theyd have better luckwhen that fail the men triedthat didnt work either if we hadnt really want a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv we wouldve just leave it definitely wasnt busy enough to be notice and ignore by the bartender so i cant overlook it of course the service have always be spotty at rock bottom so it be hardly surprise combine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom be too far from home for a night out just to drink and you get the exact formula thats keep me from go there in the pastand will keep me from go often in the future happy hour at rock bottom 2 thumb up good price the pizza be delicious drink be a few dollars off the regular price good service and the atmosphere be always casual and fun the only reason rock bottom get 3 star be because of the brew food be eh not many vegetarian options and host who will ignore you because they be too busy chat about who didnt text them back this place have the potential to be great but sadly it fall way too short in almost all areas watch the fat girls in here they will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he go to the bathroom then the indignent fat girl have to get yell at in front of everyone w in ear shoot everything else include the burger beers i devour be excellent rock bottom be our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl as expect the bar be lively the food be good and the service be accommodate the beers be better than church brew work and the bar be populate the bartender readily offer a taste of beer and give us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl i vote for rock bottom as the anchor store of the water work i havent be to rock bottom in years maybe even decadesis that even possible well either way its be awhile so with my gift certificate i take my brother out for a birthday dinner as i get older my tolerance for things like crowd and youngsters get lower and lower as a result i tell my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone go out for date night plus the pirate be play at 405 so we could enjoy our beers and the game when we arrive the bar side be already pretty pack but we be still able to get a table our server be very attentive friendly and helpful right off the bat we both order samplers so we could try all of their beers we love the fact that as she approach our table with a full tray of sample our server say i have to go back for the rest in all we be serve 10 different beers each in 3 oz glass maybe 4 i can never tell i gotta say rock bottom know their beer i like more than i didnt and very few be not to my like so the 695 10 beer sampler be well worth it during our sample we indulge on some southwest egg roll they be okay but not quite what i expect the spicy ranch be top notch though as we run out of beer we each order up a kobe burger they be both cook exactly to our like medium and to top off our wonderful even the pirate bring home a win my only complaint as a beer drinker be the cost for a growler the glass container itself be sell for 1295 thats the empty price to me thats a little ridiculous when east end only charge 3 for the bottle and penn brewery 5 pay more for the bottle than the beer inside seem like insanity to me so i walk out empty hand but it wont deter me from return i just come here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer and i have to admit that i be pretty satisfy with what we get though i couldnt find any fry pickle or onion ring on the apps section there be some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot the atmosphere of this seem pretty cool especially in the pub area fish tacos be excellent great brew beers on tap as well i very much enjoy my first visit here i get the turkey meatloaf and it be really tasty its more sausage than turkey the cheesy mash potatoes be excellent the star of the night be the appetizer the artichoke and crab dip it be awesome my only complaint be i order a red ale and they be out i have the curmudgeon instead and it be very good but still slow service below average food ill pass first time i be here i have chicken quesadillas and they be bad we go again last weekend i have the chicken avacod sandwich it be very good no fat in the chicken just a mess to eat but still awesome also have the chocolate stout cupcake it be amaze thank to the staff here for be so friendly and cool with our whole mess rock bottom allow our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphan us its not bad im not into chain kind of place but if youre with a group that doesnt do anything more adventurous youll do fine here i vacillate between 2 and 3 star but the house beer i have will make sure i come back from time to time go to rock bottom for lunch the other day and be very please my coworker have print out a coupon for a free mini appetizer the waitress tell us that they be not make mini appetizers and give us a full size chicken quesadilla if you have ever have the southwestern egg roll from chilis the fill taste like that and i be a big fan mondays be half off burger days and i try the just hot enough burger top with crispy jalapenos pepper jack cheese pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup it be delish the ketchup be so good and the fry be extremely crispy the price be a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday its totally worth it i think that the quality of food more than make up for it but dont expect for pay under 10 for a sit down i felt that the staff be very nice and the waitress be very attentive the service be quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour rock bottom be a chain brew pub one that in my opinion be just ok the restaurant be rather large with lot of seat and a pool table they have many of their own brew that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them be that good i have have several of their beers and all of them have be forgettable their food be pretty much like their beers forgettable i have have one of their burgers and their pizza and they really werent anything to write home about i feel they will impress those who have never be to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chilis of brew pubs if you be in homestead and be look for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite or at least until the burgatory open go here last night to meet folks for a friends birthday party dock one star due to a few unfortunate things that happen otherwise id be fine give this place a 3 our waiter be very attentive and keep our water and soda cup refill the food be decent overall i have a plain ol burger and a delicious berry sangria and the place overall have a nice vibe to it and be pretty comfortable and fun to be inyoud think this would just be another average place notgreatbutnotbad and id be ready to go on to the next review right there heres where i run into problems id check the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick items on menus that arent say 2000 calories in one sit their website advertise that they make skinny drink when i ask my waiter he say it be possible but that they do not normally do this and that its a hassle for the people at the bar so he didnt recommend it then why tell us on your website that youll do it additionally while we have check in advance when we make our reservation about bring a birthday cake and the restaurants ability to handle us light candle apparently there be a break down in communication we never get the candle we have ask for and in fact the poor waiter struggle to even find a lighter before realize there be no candle available obviously whatever error occur wasnt the waiters fault and we definitely thank him and tip him well for do the best that he could with what he have on a final note this be also one of those place where if you ask for a medium rare burger they will overcook it ive start order medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cook burger instead of medium well or well do final verdict go for the brew if you must and the foods nice enough i be admittedly leave a little underwhelmed mostly come here for the beer and sport fun place nothing special just like applebees chilis or fridays stick to the bar food burgers sandwich pizza wing and salads and you will be okay this be our second attempt at try rock bottom on father day the first time almost ten years ago we go in the early afternoon and they have already run out of steaks how do you do that on father day this time we go around 12 noon and beat the rush my wife get and love the berry bash sangria she just say it have too much ice in it our daughter get the root beer float which she love and i start with a mango ice tea but later switch for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasnt sweet enough we start off the the kobe beef sliders as our app it take at least 15 minutes to get them you get three sliders and they be very good my wife get a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dress to start off with which she enjoy and the lobster shrimp enchiladas as her main entree she complain about how salty it be and the fact that there be no lobster in it at all our daughter get the kid burger and fry no surprise there i order the new york strip with mash potatoes and it come with green bean as well my strip be cook perfectly and have a decent taste longhorn have a much much better quality of steak though the green bean be pretty good and my mash potatoes very bland and pretty average the kitchen sound like an live episode of hells kitchen the waiters be repeatedly ask for order at least 5 to 6 time the kitchen be back up the whole time we be there on a different note our waitress susan be very good come here for drink and the bar food skip everything else i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer so i be really really excite to have my bridal shower there my maid of honor reserve the banquet room which be very nice and separate from the rest of the restaurant my moh and mother say that the person they talk to about reservations and arrangements be wonderful and easy to get in touch with my shower be wonderful the wait staff be great and keep everyones glass full it start pour down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gift wouldnt get wet when take them out to the car the only reason this place get 4 star be because we be not allow to take our leftover food from the buffet home there be salmon chicken potatoes and mac and cheese leave over and they tell us we couldnt box it up not sure why they cant reserve it it would have just go to waste also not at all relate to the shower their trivia night be super fun southwest egg roll and fish tacos mmmmmmmmm ohh and the amaze brew i rarely give a business a superior rat but i have to say my wife and i have one of the best din experience at the rock bottom brewery the food be delicious the beer every recipe sample be amaze and the service be wonderful the staff make us feel like we be the most important guests in the restaurant please support this business i guarantee you will not be disappoint im give 4 star mostly because of the beerlarge selection decent price the food be pretty good but nothing to rave about the menu have a good variety and everything ive try have be good portion be large one side of the restaurant be the bar bar atmospherewith several tvs 2 pool table its very wide open with extremely high ceilings the other side be more for families or people who arent concern about watch sport in general it have a relax atmosphere ive always have quick friendly service i love the whole waterfront areaso much to do im not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee be a major enthusiast so i agree to tag along im glad i do our waitress be very knowledgeable about the extensive housebrewed beer selection and help me to pick one i would love the kolsch be very crisp light and drinkable the food be standard pub fare with a twist wellexecuted my burger be top with onion petals and gorgonzola and cook to perfection the waitress recommend their macaroni and cheese for a side which be definitely a good choice my only complaint be that most of the food be rather heavy and i spend the rest of the night wallow on the couch not sure i would make the hour trip to pittsburgh again but if i find myself in the city i may just stop by come with my bf we start with the crab artichoke dip it be very greasy and have virtually no crab the wedge salad be good and crisp i have the hazelnut crust chicken this have to be one of the worst dish ive ever have it be like pancake syrup over bread chicken to finish the meal we have the homemade chocolate chip cookies serve with hot fudge well there be no hot fudge it be chocolate syrup the ice cream be so crystallize from melt and refreezing all around disappoint normally the food be outstanding no more salt bread stick but they do bring back the ball park pretzels not very good cool to low warm hard dense mango ice tea be wonderful will see how the chicken come out to be continue tom and i decide to try this place out before catch a late movie on a saturday night he be a beer buff and neither of us have ever be there so we give it a go we walk in around 8pm and we be tell that there would be an hour long wait we put our name on the list and go shop around the area about 25 minutes later our table be ready park be a cluster since the lot be share with dave busters and a karaoke bar call sing sing tom drop me off at the door so i could secure our table our server jackie approach me almost immediately and bring two water to the table to start she be very attentive and funny and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant tom order a red ale and to his surprise didnt care for it jackie give tom three free sample of beers she think he would like after talk to him about his beer drink habit he love all three and choose the most bizarre and expensive beer jackie switch the red ale to the beer of toms choice and charge us for the less expensive beer very nice of her we start out with the ball park pretzels with jalapeno dip the pretzels come out quickly and they be very fresh not to mention huge we only eat one and take the other to go very good app though tom order some sort of bacon cheeseburger and i get the chicken fry chicken which be a pound chicken breast bread and fry over white cheddar mash potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw toms burger come with a small handful of fry and my meal be very spread out on my plate like something be miss not very good presentation at all the food itself be okay nothing to write home about the potatoes be my favorite part tom say that his burger be mediocre another note the bathrooms be share with the sing sing karaoke bar that be in the same build so expect drink sing women in the bathrooms and bridestobe puke in the stall next to you after enjoy too much alcohol at their bachelorette party yuck overall we might come back for the beer and service but not for the food and definitely not to use the bathroom im a regular here since their kitchen be open late and its a good option after movies their nachos be pretty good i also try their burger and chicken sandwich and theyre good as well i think the only thing i didt like be the steak taco appetizer it be too sour and kinda tasteless the cajun pasta i order be just spicy enough to keep me sip my rock bottom ipa it may be a chain but i always get that microbrew restaurant feel when im here they could upgrade the quality of the servers but ive never have a really bad experience with the service i really miss the northstar amber but the specialty beers be always good food be excellent and the service staff be friendly so after an even of enjoy a comedy show at the waterfront we head to rock bottom for some late night grub the place be pretty busy we have to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple tell us they be about to leave and we could have their bar table as nice as this be of them it be awkward stand over them as they finish their drink pay their bill and leave so finally seat i look over the drink and be the huge ipa lover that i be i go with that and it be indeed a good choice the hubby have the red ale which be also rather good the service be ok not the best not the worst but move on to more important thing the food talk about miss the mark hugely i order the mini street fish tacos you get four mini tacos with a marinate in lime piece of fish and tomatillo salsa they be just stroke away from inedible i love fish tacos i mean it be such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time execute this dish the shell be hard and literally split at the bottom when i pick them up the sour cream spray all over the plate only make them messy and the poor fish be just so overcook if i wasnt so hungry i wouldnt have eat them at all lesson learn on that the husband have the bbq chicken pizza it have bean and corn with roast red pepper on it along with some sour cream my husband be usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizzas and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings for instance he would usually just say chicken bbq and cheese nothing else i refuse to let him do that this time because i be really intrigue in the combination of ingredients on this pie and boy be i jealous when it come out it blow my crappy tacos out of the water should have stick with something simple furthermore i could care less if i come back to this location the beers be good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore and the underwhelming food seal the deal i know this be a chain but it still doesnt have to stink the food be delicious portion size generous atmosphere good our waitress lindy be outstanding have nothing but good things to say would highly recommend to everyone another good meal this time the housemade meatloaf its a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard grind beef a refresh and delicious twist on a comfort food staple serve over cheddar mash and mix veggies the server could have behave like she want to be there but everyone have a bad day once in awhile service be prompt just the same overall good experience i have to say that ive only be here when it be very busy i find the service fairly quick and any of the food ive have have be delicious i go there tonight and there be an issue with my food without go into detail i will say they handle it wonderfully our waitress mallory be very kind and she be quick to fix the problem i have the salmon for the second time and it be just as amaze as it be the first time i have one beer thats similar to a blue moon and that be good too i would go back again my husband and i get here a couple time a year always except my veggies today get great food at a decent price i love their side salad which have raisins and sunflower seed burgers be great and my husband love their chicken mac and cheese recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat poor service and food i wait 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence they finally bring my food out and leave it without ask for me to pay so i have to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay yes i have to try and give them money on to the important part food be terrible i have a burger and it be pathetic on a glorious day in the month of may my love and i stumble hungrily into rock bottom ha just kid i realize darren w hadnt review here so i have to start it cheesy the rock bottom line monday for lunch we have awesome service by ashley we werent rush and it be quite the burgers be great and half off the beer be very good we will be return for sure plan a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they do an amaze job help to pull it off service be extremely helpful professional and on point all night lauren one of the managers be reliable and pleasant throughout the entire plan process if anyone be look to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom couldnt be happier i love this restaraunt rarely have i ever receive service like i get here the food be good definitely reasonable for the price the thing that blow me away be the fact that my steak be cook to temperature this rarely ever happen at restaraunt of similar price range and quality but the servers be fantastic very attentive polite and timely the beer selection be awesome we always order the sampler i like have lot of options as far as beverages go the wait time isnt terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night and they most often call you before the quote time the desert menu be a little small but i could probably skip it anyways the ambiance be good not to cram or noisy they also have outside seat available when the weather be nice i highly recommend this establishment i love this place great food and the best beer brew on site the bourbonzola burger be the best thing you can order here the staff here be very nice and the set up have tvs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sport the music be nice and pretty mellow and the place be very spacey and the price be pretty reasonable and most importantly be the place seem to be keep clean at all time good food and large portion i order the veggie burger for 850 and i love it its one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever have a homemade patty of bean roll oats and veggies the chipotle mayo really give it that oomph my burger be more than enough for me to handle and everything be worth the price as for drink im a complete noob when it come to beer but my friend order a tap and even from a small taste i could tell it be very good quality beer bitter and sweet with a slight tang i rarely drink beer but i im go to then might as well drink the best kind there be fresh and microbrewed note there arent too many options for vegetarians the veggie burger be pretty good and id recommend it but other than that theres also the veggie tacos a few select appetizers and a few salads from which to choose ive never be crazy about the food here but my friend like it so i do eat here once in a while we stop in last night and i have the chicken finger appetizer with fry the food be a little overcook and nearly tasteless the ranch dress be barely good enough to make up for it my friend have the mac cheese with chicken and bacon which be what she order just about every time shes there it look delicious and the portion be huge ill be try this dish next time be there weve also have the ball park pretzels in the past and theyre really good im give 4 star because the service be great theres outdoor seat and the berry bash sangria be delicious if expensive well be back every time ive be here the food have always be delicious and the service have always be very exceptional my go to be the laredo burger and the mac ncheese as a side they mac n cheese be absolutely wonderful if you like garlic ive have a few other menu options as well that have be superb the beers on tap be always great my newest favorite be the first pumpkin ale one thing i really appreciate about rock bottom be that they arent one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when youre do eat the food come out fast which be great when youre starve but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eat companion theres never any rush i be just at rock bottom last night meet friends for a movie that didnt start until 11pm we get at the restaurant around 730 order drink eat and have a few more drink and then just hang out for about a half hour until it be time to walk over to the cinemas it be nice not feel rush to leave as soon as we stop order my only complaints be that sometimes meat end up be cook a little more than you often ask medium often turn into medium well but thats not a huge problem for me i also dont think the signature cocktails be worth 9 but thats more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom be a small chain overall i definitely recommend eat here if youre in the waterfront the food be standard american farea bite overprice in my mindand the beers range from mediocre to very bad the kölsch be the only decent beer of the bunch the service be good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally 2030 minutes even for just beer and apps ive be to the one at the denver airport as well but i be strand and have free meal ticket so okaybutnothingspecial pizza from rock bottom it be since its a recognizable national chain i think of place like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craftbrew experience the beer be good but the food be nothing to brag about at all ive try many things on the menu and if you have develop a foodie palate dont even bother because you will be very disappoint if you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which nothing wrong with that you will most likely enjoy rockbottom the only entree i do enjoy be the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive bean and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer otherwise you be better off skip it this place be quite big with a bar area din room area and patio area we decide to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many tvs they also have dart and two pool table which i really enjoy when you be in the bar area you can see the beer be brew through the window which be really cool i order the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend order the white wheat both of which be brew by rock bottom they both taste delicious and be exactly what i need for a hot day my friend order the fry chicken entree which come with mash potatoes and of course she give me a few bite since we always share it be a pretty delicious meal but the fry crust fell off a few piece which i be not really a fan of i order the sante fe salad with grill chicken not fry the salad be okay i be expect more flavor overall but i didnt really get them it be a good experience and will most likely be back when i be around the waterfront area i be not a fan of chain restaurants typically and have to slow break my boyfriend from want to eat at chain restaurants all of the time the one chain that i cant break from be rock bottom their beer be always good as far as their staple go i really love their white ale their seasonal ipas have be good and my favorite seasonals of all time include their chocolate raspberry stout yes it taste as good as it sound they have it last year around christmas and their smoky bbq brown ale taste like summer complement bbq amazingly they have it this past summer i buy a growler of it lol as far as their food go i typically stay away from the appetizers 10 and up be a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go ive have their southwestern roll and they be good but not worth 10 almost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich its my favorite chicken sandwich so good the chicken be actually grill which go for all of their chicken sandwich and i love the char flavor that it have the bun be soft but sturdy and doesnt fall apart while eat the sandwich the sauce be amaze the onion frizzle be the best and last but not least theres a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich mhm i love it my boyfriend usually get the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and love it as well another item i always get their apple coleslaw ive yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant so simple yet oh so good they also recently change their fry and these be much better than their old ones their side salads be awesome as well they be decent in size spring mix top with sunflower seed raisins half of a hard boil egg which i give to the boyfriend chop cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons yum i usually order the same thing every time i go i steer off my normal path once and order the buffalo mac and cheese and find it to be quite tasteless which turn me off to try new items there plus i be just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else service be always great the bartenders be friendly i love this place ask about their rock bottom reward be careful the servers cant pay attention to save their live and the management care even less i want to make sure people know how careless the management be particularly mark who seem to let his staff run around i always enjoy rock bottom standard beers on tap be always great and their rotate selection usually have a hit as well i prefer the bar seat as to the din room but this be a good way to separate the family din from those of us without kiddos nachos nachos nachos truly the best in the area great burgers chili and salads reallyi dont think ive have a bad meal here nice outdoor seat in the summer this be a great place to watch a game or just hang out ice counter at the bar to keep your drink cold i know they have other cocktails here but i cant order them at a beer place ive see them and they do look good but im stick to the beer selection they have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week service be always great whether there be two or 10 of us this be a okay place to eat the food be nothing special i guess what they have go for them be the beer order the guacamole for the starter which be okay but for 850 and the portion be not worth it rice cajun taco be not cook well would i go there again maybe if your into beer and watch the game then yeah go there ball park pretzelwould eat again i come to rock bottom look for a great beer full of hop that bring a refresh sensation and satisfaction i then open the menu scan look for those select bar items to pair with my great beer i saw an extensive list of items from chicken finger to salads i notice a ball park pretzel with a jalapeño cheese dip i be blow away the fact that i get 2 pretzels amaze me i order within 25 minutes of seat my pretzels hit the table within minutes the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese open my sense but i know we could step this shit up i ask for mustard and what do you know grey poupon dijon mustard be in front of my eye i combine that shit and life evolve i go to heaven it take me 35 minutes to write this review because i take a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence good look rock bottom keep up the good work the improv comedy club at the waterfront be the best comedy club in pittsburgh because there be only one other one and this one get more famous comedians i go there just about every other week pros great comedians all year round the fooddrinks be very good and the wait staff be wonderful the improv be a great venue for upcoming and new comedians i always see new local talent open for national comedians in one show you will see 12 local comedians and 12 national tour comedians the improv have a nice environment inside with general admission seat first come first serve the email list be essential in order to receive free ticket package and perk as well as reminders of upcoming comedians con price can be steep it be expensivedifficult to be a regular food and drink be not cheap no specials expect to pay 15 40 for ticket depend on the headliner with a two item minimum wait in line before the show wouldnt be bad if you werent force to stand outside in any and all weather condition if it be rain and youd like a good seat you will pay the price overall this 21 venue be a great place to spend a night out with friends or love ones you may buy ticket in advance onlinephone or buy your ticket at the box office at the location i highly recommend join the mail list to receive free ticket check the calendar for upcoming show and open mic nights during the week support local comedy and enjoy the improv at the waterfront good club for a good laugh high food price most comedy club be 2 item min the food be less than stellar i wouldve enjoy burger king more service be decent i believe the waiterswaitresses could hustle a little more or the club should hire more waiterswaitresses i get grouchy when my glass be sit empty for more than 2 mins they have good act come around here and often give out free ticket particularly ine summer ive never actually pay full price for a ticket here the twoitem minimum be bite bothersome to me thoughi dont mind the requirement so much but the quality isnt good and the price be high our four items total come to about 30 two appetizers and two beers and the apps be really nothing to write home about and the servers arent even very friendly also bewarethey have a lot of rule here they wont seat till the whole party be there if you get dinner reservations everyone in the party have to order dinner automatic gratuity add to the check etc etc the box office be also weirdyou get your ticket at this window complete with microphone and slideunder slotthen you walk into the club and the box office be completely open and the workers be just sit right there so i dont get the whole hoopla with the window all in all though the seat be comfy enough the atmosphere be pretty nice and the act be good i always enjoy a good comedy club and though im a loyal helium fan i gotta give prop to the improv near pittsburgh they choose a great location with surround restaurants of all genres and fun bar and shop we buy ticket to see a comedian i have never hear of he be decent for 25 each with a two item purchase minimum i really dislike that rule but you cant really get around it the only thing i didnt like aka hat be have to wait in line outside before the show start it be freeeeezing they should put heaters outside seriously come here to see charlie murphy park be nightmare i would expect nothing less on a saturday night the 15 minute wait to get inside be torture they need to implement a system where if you purchase ticket in advance you dont have to wait outside once inside you we be seat pretty quickly seat be first come first serve the server be pretty quick to take our order i misread the menu description and didnt realize my bbq sandwich come with cheese i dont eat cheese and have send my order back the waiter be gracious and return with my modify order in about 15 minutes ive never hear of throw cheese pull pork sandwich maybe its a northern thing we get our check quickly and without issue im huge snl fan so naturally if someone whos be in the cast be tour ill come here to see them some have be really greatjim breuer some have be surprisingly very badtracy morgan but its always be a pleasant experience at the venue theres not a bad seat in the house and its small enough that you get to see and hear everything from the stage beware if you sit in the very front you know whats go to happen a couple downsides wait outside in a line in the dead of winter the lobby be so small youre force to wait outside until the first show start or the first show let out and if you want a good seat you may be wait in line for a while burr the two drink minimum i kinda get why they do it to make money of course but this mean they jack up the price of water down drink better to stick with beer and wine at these place no frou frou drink for me also as to be expect the foods not that great in a perfect foodie world place that serve food would make it fantastic since thats not go to happen you just go into those place hop for the best ive never have anything great here nacho platter too many re fry bean to little nachosannnnnd im out so what do we learn here good venue stick to beer and wine and eat at a better restaurant beforehand the talent be really what youre there for so enjoy the show ive be here twice now and like the others you really only come to improve comedy club for the show very reasonably price for show though they have the two item minimum so would suggest they all be drink the food leave little to be desire we decide for the sake of time to grab dinner at the venue since the show start at 7 have a free appetizer coupon we order the spinach and artichoke dip along with the saute grill chicken spinach and artichoke dip be good though cheesy rich along with cheese sprinkle on top of the chip saute grill chicken hmmm i think the chicken be freeze definitely not fresh and the guacamole be artificial with a glop of cheese it look like a mess with big ole pile of fry a lot of food for 10 service have always be pleasant though they do automatically tack on the tip for you at 18 theres nothing like a saturday night fill with some good laugh a few chuckle and a couple of good guffaw throw in for good measure thats exactly what we enjoy on saturday night we hit the comedy club for an even of tammy pescatelli the hubby and i have enjoy her routine on tv and on the occasional dve morning show she didnt fail to give us a good even of laugh the big surprise be gene collier yep of the postgazette sport writer fame as the opener what a great open act he crack wise about the peril of be 58 and a baby boomer we could relate the sightlines be lack there be a rather large woman at the table in front of us with massive pittsburgh big hair all night long my own head bob from side to side as i attempt to actually watch the show and not just listen to it as she reach repeatedly and unceasingly for her tableful of snack with a 2 drink minimum my first drink be weak and the 2nd be quite strong all in all the two balance each other out but then you dont go for the drink do you an enjoyable even tom green be appear here on jan 22 2012 he be hilarious the improv be an excellent comedy club in past show ive see jim krenn margaret cho billy elmer and so many more i forget much like live from the improv on tv the brick back drop make it feel like the nyc improv hint eat elsewhere the food isnt so great have an appetizer until you get to another restaurant most comedians head over to the rock bottom after to imbibe dave attell be a regular at both place two drink minimum drink them slow and go elsewhere after the show decent clean as far as i could sense in the dim about on par for what youd expect for a higherend comedy club that include the 10drink twodrink minimum automatic 18 gratuity and the comic spout out the obligatory dont forget to tip your waitress try to judge the place on its own merit and not on the entertainment value of the comics if the latter since we be here for frank caliendo id have give the place the full 5 star if only for him alone total cash bleed out of my pocket bring it down from what could have be a 4star experience for us 80 for ticket online include 10 service fee and tax we have to this be a sell out show add 25 for drink gratuity and more tax be talk 3digits of for less than 2 hours of entertainment squeeze in between other patrons and glasswielding servers while you sit on rickety chair thats what a headliner act will cost ya will you see us here again probably but cost make it unlikely to be a weekly thing for us my friends i all purchase groupons for the pittsburgh improv on or around march 22nd 2012 at that time only a few big name comedians be list on the improvs website as special events you can use the groupon on anything that isnt a special event that seemd reasonable the day the groupons be purchase my friend katrina call reserve two ticket to jim jeffries for 330 at 10pm they allow her to use her groupon give her a confirmation code everything shortly after they change many of the comedians on their website include jim jeffries to special events when i call i be tell i could not use my groupon the same thing happen to many of my friends its a classic bait switch these comedians be not special events until after the groupon come out in addition other restrictions such not be able to use the groupons on saturdays have to use the additional four vouchers for one show be not list under the restrictions when the groupon be for sale so tonight my friends i have pretty much resolve ourselves to the fact that we be not go to the improv because they wouldnt allow us to use our groupons but i walk over to the will call window with my friend katrina so she could at least get her ticket big surprise she be tell they didnt have her reservation or her name in their computers they wouldnt give her the ticket its an absolute joke of a deal how be everyone go to use their groupons by sept if all of the show be special events now in addition no one at the improv answer the phone or respond to email my friends i about 10 of us total be all get refund through groupon andor our credit card company we be all report the improv to the better business bureau etc the pittsburgh improv be extremely shady do not care about their customers you know that place where youve never go then you go then youre go all the time well the improv for me be one of these place i be thankful to have a venue to see some of my favorite comedians most recently i saw hannibal burris tommy johnigan and doug benson all three performances be a hoot good time on saturday afternoon at 220pm i go to see doug benson i be accompany by my boyfriend you may know doug benson from the hit documentary super high me ok so pros wonderfully talented comedians clean bathrooms pretty wait staff have coors light on tap 575 per draft every seat in the house be a good seat con expensive drink expensive food flavorless food dirty silverware far from my house mayo with french fry any way i have enjoy all my visit to the waterfront i can certainly see myself see more show at the improve the club be well maintain and the wait staff be friendly bring a lot of money with you youre go to need it i dont know if its true everywhere but at this improve there be be 2 item person minimum order requirement they serve us warm mayo with our fry what be this holland that sht be gross it be both gross and also unusual anyhow to catch a comedy show at the improve be a pleasure the place do what it do best comedy the food however blah first off if you go to a show please note there be a two item per person minimum this mean that from their extensive menu of overprice bar food and drink you be require to choose two items each second the sodas be not free refill i learn that one the hard way get water third before tip your server please make sure she hasnt already take her cut out even after pay for two very bland overprice meals and way too many diet coke i think that my bill be rather high upon further inspection i notice that my server have take an 18 gratuity the menu explicitly say that an automatic gratuity will be take out for party of six or more but there be only two of us and we werent even drink i find this tactic awfully presumptuous and leave her tip at the 18 even though i typically tip well over 20 overall i dont like the idea of be require to purchase food just to see a comedy show i can see why they do it but if i be require to buy a crappy popcorn and overprice pop every time i go to the movies i would be far less incline to go as i be not incline to go to the improv again the pittsburgh improv be unfortunately another great idea hamstring by the detail of mediocre execution some specific examples at the end the setup be nice a delightfulif a bite sterilereproduction of what youd think a comedy club should like if you watch enough tv the interior be clean the seat be comfortable and its an ok atmosphere to see a show and laugh its too small however to attract many of the best act which limit its ability to ever become the central hub for pittsburgh comedy most of the big name that have recently come through pittsburghjim gaffigan louis ck second cityall perform elsewhere though they manage to get bob saget to their credit but the biggest problem be the food and drink theyre very up front about their mandatory two item minimum but the force service require that you spend extra money and get interrupt by waitstaff at least several time during the show the price be well above what id consider reasonable give the quality and id begrudginglyor even happilyjust shrug off the cost the same way i would a stadium concession stand markupbut the food be bad youre force to either a buy extremely overprice drink 350 for a soda for example with no refillsor ten dollars for one with refill or b buy moderately overprice food which you wouldnt want in the first place i think the ten dollar chicken sandwich look reasonable until a few bite in i decide id rather just throw away the money than keep eat it still i think this place have a lot of potential the core idea be very workable and they do attract some really good comedians two star for now with high hop for improvements a few specific drawbacks which could be very easily fix 1 a lot of the drink didnt have price on them i know this isnt uncommon but at a venue where every question you ask interrupt not only your own showviewing experience as well as the experience of your neighbor its an incredibly poor decision here make everything on the menu exceptionally clear its not that hard 2 put the drink price on the website too an improv representative have personally respond to many of these yelp review and she once say our menus and price be list on our website which make for easy plan im call shenanigans not all the price be on the website which make for difficult plan 3 remind me to tip my server during the show and add an automatic gratuity to the check make me feel like youre try to trick me its kind of an unprofessional way to say goodbye to ones customers 4 since the 350 soft drink dont come with free refill the servers shouldnt ask would you like a refill on that or anything of the sort they should ask would you like another one instead they should also respond to request for refill by say we dont offer refill but id be happy to get you another one just because theres a 10 dollar refillable soda option on the menu doesnt mean people all figure it out most patrons dont even bother read the beverage section of the menu if all they want be a standard beverage offer almost everywhere like a cola or diet cola and the read difficulties impose by the darkness make them even less likely to browse the offer i love the improv i think its a great way to start or spend a night nothing like a laughter fill night i think its great that we get so many great comedians come our way owen benjamin pablo francisco super funny tammy pescatelli not so much things you should be aware of the staff be really strict on the 2 drink minimum so be prepare to spend money on the pricey food and drink i kinda wish their menu be a little bite more extensive their service be spotty the wait staff be a little iffy i have be here many time and sometimes i get an attentive waitress and sometimes not most recently our waitress be rude didnt bother with pleasantries and barely take notice of us also beware of the fact they automatically add gratuity if our waitress be nice i would be more than glad to add to it but this time i be like no way ps when i use my groupon i didnt have any trouble my husband and i go to do something fun the comedy be great the food however be mediocre at best in addition we be seat in the last row and 10 minutes into the headliner they sit someone else at our table so that they be in front of us i could not see a thing when we receive our check they have add an 18 gratuity without permission or notification i will not be return anytime soon who doesnt love to laugh the improv be a great place to go for a good show a few time a year the venue be clean the comedians be good for the price and many time you get a steal and can see a great comedian for a low price ietommy johnagin however be advise if you attend more than one show every couple of months you will see some of the same open act repeat this be my biggest gripe with the improv ive be to the improv about 3 time over the past 4 months and have see the same open act a few time i think they cycle through the same 45 comedians be there not more talented comedians in pittsburgh as note in other review another area of improvement be the drink and food i always attend the late show so that i can eat elsewhere the food be mediocre bar food at best nothing more need to be say about that i definitely dont mind the two drink minimum ive be know to consume more than two drink in one set but the drink be insanely overprice 5 for a miller lite 4 for a snapple 10 for a fountain drink with refill youre better off have your two drink during the show and go over the sing sing after for a draft or four in addition since they start offer a large groupon discount the improv have be pack be aware that if you only have two people in your party they may seat strangers at your table who be 6 feet tall and block your view we come to the improv for the first time on friday night for my wifes work holiday party we arrive early for dinner and drink from a predetermine menu dinner start with a salad of clearly bag almost brown iceberg lettuce with some croutons and frozenthenthawed look tomatoes that be pinkish at best i take a few bite of this unappetizing poor excuse for a salad and i can tell you it be downright tragic dinner arrive and since there wasnt any vegetarian options on this predetermine menu we receive a dish that be suppose to contain meat with the meat omit it be a huge pile of spaghetti in a bowl it look sloppy and taste worse than it look the pasta be overcook and the tomato sauce be just water down puréed can tomatoes i saw trace of onion in my dish but didnt taste them at all i be so hungry that i salt the heck out of this abomination and take a few bite yuck i didnt make a dent in this crapfest for dessert we be give a choice of chocolate cake which my wife order and cheesecake which i order the chocolate cake have freezer burn inexcusable it wasnt edible the cheesecake be only a hair better but it have obviously come out of the freezer as well i know people arent come here for the food but if you be force them to order things off of your menu to fulfill some outdated requirements two drinktwo menu item minimum then at least make some halfway decent food it doesnt even have to be memorablejust not offensive which it be have i pay for any of this i would have make a huge stink but i try to be polite and push my food around and make small talk the comedians be good the venue be niceish and we get to sit in the front because we arrive early for our event not always the best thing in a comedy club we only get pick on a little bite but damn i be hungry i find myself fantasize about all of the crappy waterfront restaurants and how id rather be therehow id rather be heat up a discount microwave dinnerhow id rather have a giant bowl of captain crunchhow id rather go back in time and eat spaghetti from my high school cafeteriawhat a dreadful din experience my car be also violate in the park lot i have an adorable german license plate on the front of my adorable german car which be steal while i be eat hideous food which be just the slap in the face i want when finally retreat to my car i feel sick in so many different ways about this experience as a whole the improv should consider outsource the food prep to a cater company i truly believe thats the only thing that can save this place do yourself a favor and eat beforehand and just order a beer well two i guess other diners at our table complain about the quality of the cocktails so id steer clear of those unless there be a cant miss type of comedian here i cant ever picture go back to the improv id give the comedians 4 star and the food zero star spend new years eve at the comedy club to bring the new year i be new but it be a good time we have unlimited champagne fruit and cheese the comedy be good the service be great the atmposhere be okay but it be a comedy clud you should check it out comedy club bring a little spice to the city enjoy this be my second visit to the club and it be still a blast my girlfriends buy ticket for john witherspoon for my bachelorette we be all look forward to it and it be hilarious he be wonderful the servers be fantastic they always come back to check in on us and make sure we have plenty to eat and drink i suggest the pink cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert the only reason it isnt 5 star be because they have us wait an hour past the time we be to enter the build we be to see the 9pm show so the doors be to open at 845pm they come out and explain that the show have run over and we wouldnt be able to even enter the build until 920pm it be 28 degrees outside we finally be able to enter the build order drink then the show finally start at 945pm the host do offer a blanket apology which be nice but hardly make up for the fact the show start almost an hour late i have be here twice in the last month its a pretty great time my first visit the service be pretty poor and the food be cold by the time it get to the table we have to sit all the way in the back and the comedian be not that good although that be no fault of the club but when i go to the second show the service be much improve the burger i order be fantastic and warm our waitress keep the drink come without interrupt us while the comedian be on stage we be also able to sit in the front this time and it be a great experience ill be go back soon good i cant comment on the food or the bathrooms but from what experience it be great the drink be decent and i believe you must order two items at minimum the staff be quick but they should have more people work on a saturday night before you can ask for anything else they bolt to the next table or to the kitchen the comics we saw be funny as well will definitely go back i love that we have a great comedy club in pittsburgh with a great location at the waterfront perfect for a date night and i recommend go to a later show and grab dinner beforehand i receive an online coupon code for 5 ticket for john heffron what a dealdef check for deal before you pay full price for any show here we go early to pick up the ticket at the ticket office people be line up outside about an hour before the show and it be freeze out i have no interest in do this so we grab a beer across the street at rock bottom once they open the doors 15 minutes before show time the line go quickly and even though we be at the end we still get seat at a table in the back it be not huge inside so there arent really any bad seat they usually have an mc for the night who start warm up the crowd this guy be funny and so be the open act before john heffron my only complaint about this place be that they have a two drink minimum and the price be outrageous 950 for a mix well drink and 7 for draft beers the soda be 350 yikes at least we didnt pay full price for the ticket i be so excite when my husband give me ticket to go here to see funny man bill crawford part of the dve morning show for those of you who never hear of him that be funny because as i be tell people about go it become clear there be a lot of people that havent oh well let me mention this be my first time there so i be warn in advance of the possible long wait outside and the two item minimum well to my pleasant surprise there be no wait walk right in greet an usher show us to our seat and we wait less than 5 minutes to be ask for our order this be nice i will say that the show start at 8pm and we be there by 720 or so there be already people seat so we be by no mean very early and heck there be people with full course meals and table of 10 the price of the mix drink be not disclose on the menu lead me to believe that it may leave me short for the mortgage next month but they do have a 60 minute dogfish head ipa for 600 now that may seem rather expensive and it be but doable so i indeed do it my husband get a domestic and it be between 45 buck we opt not to eat there as we be go to rock bottom after ward and i will get to that review later so the show be good there be moments that i think the comedians may have go off track and be just banter but luckily enough they rebound and get back to make everyone laugh instead of be uncomfortable there be a total of 4 comedians the mc and two open act for crawford i actually really enjoy them the one or two things i didnt like about the place the bathrooms be in the lobby as this seem normal there be no separate area to enter back into the room without have to make your way through people who be wait to be seat this wasis stupid i be actually nervous that they be go to stop me and ask for my ticket which they safely secure at my first entrance the same also go for smoke since we be so early i take a break and it be again awkward reentering maybe they need to have some type of system to get around this a stamp hand a ticket stub not sure but i know i would have felt better unlike feel like i be sneak into the place i would definitely return to the improv i just hope i always have a rather positive experience it isnt often that my wife and i get to go out but we have ticket to see the wonderful lisa landry and figure since we be go to the improv we may as well eat there too i should have get on here and read the review before make that decision we have what seem to be a typical experience at the improv we be hand a paper menu with 4 items on it when we walk in the door there be no other menu at the table and our waitress didnt offer us one either she want our order but as we be look around the place we realize that most of those around us be eat items that not on the menu provide to us when ask about another menu our waitress tell us if we give her our drink order shell see what she can do the table next to us hand over their menus so we have something to work with our drink come we finally put our order inand that be the last time we saw our waitress for almost a full 30 minutes when she finally come back all she want be to know if we want a 2nd round of drink after 30 minutes i be finally go to get a second beer what about our food we ask oh be her answer now accord to the menu dinner come with a side salad a complimentary glass of champagne and a chocolate mousse dessert thats all good and fine after a couple of minutes someone not our waitress finally bring out our meals when we ask him about our salads his reply be do you want me to take your food back really do you want me to take your food back after almost 45 minutes at this point we have receive 1 round of drink and have see our waitress only twice and have just receive our food no i dont want you to take our food back halfway through eat our meals which be by this time cold our waitress finally come back with our second beers she ask us how everything be we ask about our salads she say she be tell we didnt want them really be this a joke be it somehow part of the comedy routine that be go on sadly no the service didnt get any better the food be lousy thankfully the standup be great lisa lisa and matt all put on a hilarious show will i ever go back dont know it take us an hour and a half to drive the 16 miles to get there thank to traffic i do know that if we do it again we will leave the house much earlier and eat somewhere else the two drink minimum work at the improv because you will not get your waitress to your table more than that to order more drink in case youre interest i be a chef who have be in the service industry for more than 30 years and work every position possible in restaurants and bar so yes i do have a preconceive notion as to how service and food should be even on valentines day my husband and i love go to comedy show and have see some pretty good act at the improv ticket price arent bad either i be very particular about where i sit and the person who seat you be will to let you sit where you choose especially if its on a thursday or sunday night since those arent particularly busy nights i do have one bad experience which be why im give this review 3 star instead of 4 it only take one poor experience people my husband and i go to see one of our favorite comedians on a thursday night there be a twoitem minimum so we decide we would just eat dinner at the show well we be mistake first of all our waitress be rude and slow after sit there for 5 or 6 minutes without service she finally come over and ask what we want we both order a drink and food to which she tell us that the kitchen catch on fire earlier that day so all they have be salads and desserts i be annoy that she even ask what we want instead of start out with this important fact at any rate i order a caesar salad and a beer it come out and its iceburg lettuce with shred cheese tomatoes and other veggies in other word a regular salad i inform the waitress of this and she seem totally confuse i suppose she do not understand the difference which be odd overall i felt that there be no apology for the fact we couldnt eat let alone everyone else in the place salad or dessert arent the greatest choices when you be expect to eat dinner at the show i think the improv should have waive the twoitem minimum on this occasion even if it cost them money afterwards i email the improv with my concern never hear back that be say i will most likely return to the improvbut not for the service because its a great place to see comedy show and isnt that expensive customer service be terrible i go here for the first time the other night and have a great time the comedian be hilarious and it be a great intimate set for a fun night out with friends my only complaint be that it be a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket but every person need to buy 2 items of fooddrink and the drink arent cheap around 1012 however i would definitely go back sometime wast there last friday seat right in front if the stage the show be good the headliner while a bite long be good fantastic service from our waitress will definitely go back if the improv chain didnt bring in such amaze comedians this place would be totally screw i always have fun watch the comedians but i cant help but leave with such a bitter taste in my mouth from how much of a rip off this place be first you buy the ticket but if you buy online you have an outrageous service charge the real kicker be have to buy a minimum of 2 items during the show beers be 5 or 6 and the cheapest things on the menu i believe cocktails be 1113 i think glass of wine be around 8 there be a pretty good selection of food options the improv do have a lot of great comedians who pass through even the open act be generally great line up early if you want a great seat right in the front the point be a night at the improv will be fun but if you arent prepare for it it can end up be a pretty unexpectedly and unreasonably expensive affair great night out i dont know if christopher titus set the ticket price or the club do but at 25 a ticket we will be go back often great line up of top name act come to town extremely nice staff highly recommend absolutely love it at the improv i saw sheryl underwood and she be fantastic it be my first time be at the improv after years of say that i want to go it really do meet my expectations the ambiance be invite with warm light and a good amount of seat for a smaller place we be 8th in line so we have good choice of seat though we be encourage to fill the seat in the front by the stage first the seat be layer in tiers each tier have a long booth with table and chair for seat it be very comfortable roomy and an interactive set up the stage be close to the seat some table be right at the stage with little space between you and the comedian which make it very interactive and fun we arrive at the improv around 945 pm for a show that start at 1030 pm with doors open at 1000 pm we wait in line until the doors open at about 10151020 pm so they be really behind schedule the show start around 1045 pm with two open comedians before the main act the show be over around 100 be the only negative be that the staff be not very friendly and immediately tell me that i have to buy a minimum of two items off of the menu 30ticket isnt enough i be not hungry and do not want to drink so this be a bite frustrate especially because it wasnt disclose on the ticket or anywhere else the server do not hold us to the 2 minimum purchase requirement and my friend and i get away get 3 drink for the night the food menu look great and the price seem reasonable though if you want water you be look at 5 for fiji or sparkle it be 8 for a glass of wine 11 for bottomless soda complete with a take home improv glass the other thing that i didnt like be that an employee take your ticket while youre wait in line and mark your hand with a dry erase marker after one bathroom trip the mark be go so i think they need a more effective way to mark you as an already pay customer since the employee take your proof of purchase these negative do not affect my overall experience negatively and i would most certainly go back it be a fun place where you be guarantee to have a good time with a lot of laughter sowe get here and seat by 635pm order place drink serve now it be 752pm one of my party have still not receive his chicken sandwich i have my shrimp diablo it be as describe spicy and good but hour plus for a chicken sandwich be unacceptable we also send an order of chicken finger backdryer than sand and my fiancés chicken caesar salad chicken be as dry as the chicken finger barely edible in fact she didnt eat more than 3 piece of it upgrade the food service and this place would be somewhat a lil better the waterfront at homestead be insane and save me the trip of drive all the way to ross park mall anyway the giant eagle here be enormous as youd imagine its still a standard giant eagle aka the best grocery store ever this be the best giant eagle in the area and be the most like grocery store in bay area heres why 1 they sell beer 2 huuuuuge produce selection 3 naturalorganic foods section cereal pasta soup etc and fancy chocolate bar 4 long isle of ethnic foods include mexican indian italian asian and of course jewish 5 function bakery with fresh appetizing bread and desserts i be still loyal to allegro hearth though the store be huge and i havent be to all of it yet but they also have nicer flower balloon homeseasonal section dvd rentals and a photo center as well as a drivethrough pharmacy it seem as this ge just might be the answer to my grocery store woes probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county if not all of southwestern pa its selection be considerably larger than what you can find in most giant eagle and it have more upscale items i live an easy walk from the swissvale giant eagle but i often drive to this location for the superior selection nice giant eagle not as nice as their new market district but you can look at this giant eagle and see how they come up with the market district idea and roll with it fresh make sushi good cheese selection awesome bakery wahhhhh theyre remodel this one and its frustrate i swear i dont mind change i really dont i should have see this come there be telltale sign of this happen first they switch the pharmacy to the other end of the store where the now defunct iggle video be thats aok with me i didnt use the pharmacy anyway but then then they move the whole toiletries section over there they put my spaghetti and ethnic food section by the way i love that ethnic food include spaghetti to where my tylenol be my kitty food be now where my spaghetti once be can you tell how exasperate im get do i mention i dont mind change but heres the thing i really hate grocery shop its kinda sorta my own fault because i must read every label to make sure im not eat something with 25 grams of fat and 5000 calories even though ice cream may go into my cart from time to time so go to this giant eagle frequently be nice because i know be everything be now i dontwahhh ok ill stop cry i know ill eventually be back im sure it will be an even better more magical grocery shop experience once theyre do but i cant take it for right now ill be force to shop at the ghetto bird down in the southside until my former 1 store be all shiny and new again i like this giant eagle they have the organic section and theyre currentlyfeb 2011 in the process of remodel too which be both annoy now and excite for the future pros always seem to be decent park available they have those cute little doubletier cart organics section wine vend machine thats freak awesomeyay pennsylvania lot of selfcheckout lanes con sometimes the staff be a bite cranky but that can occur anywhere i guess as far as ges go this location be great it have basically everything you need and be well organize you can find a lot of ethnic ingredients you cant get at other ge store they also offer a wine kiosk hot bar salad bar and bulk olives i would venture to say this be better than the market district waterfront geagle be my primary market now that theyve expand and reorganize i rarely even have to set foot in target anymore yippie theres a wine kiosk suck it pa liquor laws you can buy crazy expensive 6 pack cheese market bakery salad and hot bar butcher florist dry cleaners international foods pharmacy and a little cosmeticsbeautybath area they usually have a sufficient number of lanes open and it doesnt get nearly as crowd as market district i do wish a bulk spice selection be include as part of the expansion but you cant always get what you want i suppose youre get an extra star for two solid reason one be because the remodel be over and the store be pretty again and a bite fancier two and thee most important part this iggle have the best quality and well make sushi out of any iggles out there believe me ive eat many a rainbow roll from many different locations around the burgh and nothing have compare dare i say its as close as you get to go to a good sushi restaurant bold statement right i just love me some sushi and want it often quick and convenient and this serve all those purpose with uphold the quality need a quick sushi fix this place be it this be easily one of the best giant eagle ive ever be to huge very nice selection easily comparable to whole foods go to their cheese market and be pleasantly surprise with the selection i get beemster vlaskas an amaze gouda very large park lot this place have amaze selection when it come to some things and zero selection when it come to others we pop in here a couple time over the weekend i spend in pit and both time they didnt really have what we be look for visit 1 liquid smoke visit 2 hawaiian roll i know these items must exist in pa just not geagle they do however have crazy selection when it come to things likecorned beef brisket or anything that have potato in it my californian mind be boggle by the variety of brand and cut of corn beef that be available too bad that wasnt what i be there for oddly enough of all the giant eagle i have visit in pittsburgh this be the only location that carry the toothpaste that ive use for most of my life outside of pittsburgh the location be clean and the staff be friendly i sometimes resent have a market district be the closest giant eagle to my apartment as many of the items that i buy there be severely overprice but whenever i run out of groceries and toothpaste at the same time i take the hike down to waterfront to shop here although they may not carry all the groceries that id like this be a absolutely beautiful giant eagle i only stop in to grab a quick bite from the prepare foods section but i be rather impress by how clean it be it be 9 oclock at night and they still have a huge section of prepare foods available the starbucks inside be close probably due to the fact it be a sunday night but that be another plus\n"

They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  \\n\\nOur first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead, a trip across the Hi Level Bridge was in order.  Little did we realize that the bridge was under construction and it took nearly 40 minutes to get across it.  Upon arriving at the restaurant we were presented with the task of finding a place to park which proved to be a daunting task.  This place was absolutely packed due to several locations sharing a parking lot.  After we got inside, our wait was about 45 minutes but luckily we were able to find a seat inside the packed bar while we waited.\\n\\nThe food at Rock Bottom is quite tasty, but it is all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers leading their menu.  They also have entrees such as steaks, but this place is not exactly known for their high class food products.  I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food and we quickly determined that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar.\\n\\nOur order consisted of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu including Chicken Nachos, Quesadillas and Ball Park Pretzels.  We had planned on splitting a meal for dinner, but by the time the appetizers arrived, we knew we had way too much food in front of us. \\n\\nThe nachos were on a gigantic plate and piled high with cheese, sour cream, guacamole and shredded chicken.  Containing just the right amount of jalapenos they had a nice little kick as well.  In much the same way, the quesadilla was much more than an appetizer portion.  With shredded meats and cheeses overflowing from the tortilla, there was enough food here for a two person entree.  The Ball Park Pretzels are the reason we come to this place.  They are always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt.\\n\\nAs far as the beers are concerned, I ordered up the sampler so that I could get a taste of the various brews.  They make a wide assortment of brews, from the Bud Lightesque \\\"Lumpy Dog\\\" to a dark \\\"Brew masters Choice.\\\"  I found many of the beers to be quite tasty, however, nothing exactly special about them.  I would be that a taste test would find one hard pressed to chose the Rock Bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack.  Don't get me wrong - still excellent brews, but I would expect more from a place that claims to be a brewery.\\n\\nI give it 3 out of 5 Rinsem's due to the lack of originality in the brews and the amount of traffic involved with getting in and out of the place.\",\n          \"I would have to say I'm pretty partial to Rock Bottom, I have been going almost every Thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic \\\"Team Trivia\\\". My friends and I love the atmosphere, the DJ (Todd), and the service that we get at Rock Bottom. \\n\\nEvery week when we go a menu is never needed because we pretty much know everything we want on it, except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new! \\n\\nAs an avid Rock Bottomer, hands down I have never in my life had a better spicy spinach cheese dip than I have had here at Rock Bottom. Whether I have eaten dinner or not before I come down to the restaurant, my favorite and my food of choice is the ENORMOUS Ball park pretzels with the cheese dip. It is a meal itself! The mixture of onions, cheese, spinach and tomatoes is perfection! \\n\\nAnother favorite of mine is the Barbecue Chicken Pizza, it has a great kick to it and it's big enough for two people. \\n\\nThe service has always been super great and now since we go often we have developed a great relationship with some of the wait staff. \\n\\nA truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people! \\n\\nCome to Team Trivia every Thursday at 8pm!\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"business_id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"McikHxxEqZ2X0joaRNKlaw\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"clear_text\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"dined in twice food ok atmosphere good\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"tokens\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"non_stopwords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"stemming\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"dine twice food ok atmospher good\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"lemmatized\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 83,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"din in twice food ok atmosphere good\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 3,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"neg\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.09453121884888369,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.778,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 50,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.055\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"neu\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.12046596279767612,\n        \"min\": 0.222,\n        \"max\": 0.957,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.695\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"pos\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.11957674278071981,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.58,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 70,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.179\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"compound\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.46443332153266925,\n        \"min\": -0.8885,\n        \"max\": 0.9988,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 82,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.4404\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

      "rock bottom brewery in homestead be always a good time they brew their own semimicro brew here and generally have as many as eight brew to choose from saturday night c and i stop by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages our first issue of the night be get to rock bottom as the restaurant be locate in homestead a trip across the hi level bridge be in order little do we realize that the bridge be under construction and it take nearly 40 minutes to get across it upon arrive at the restaurant we be present with the task of find a place to park which prove to be a daunt task this place be absolutely pack due to several locations share a park lot after we get inside our wait be about 45 minutes but luckily we be able to find a seat inside the pack bar while we wait the food at rock bottom be quite tasty but it be all pretty standard bar fare with the nachos and burgers lead their menu they also have entrees such as steaks but this place be not exactly know for their high class food products i be pleasantly surprise by the quality of the food and we quickly determine that this would not be your average plate of nachos in a bar our order consist of a plethora of items from their appetizer menu include chicken nachos quesadillas and ball park pretzels we have plan on split a meal for dinner but by the time the appetizers arrive we know we have way too much food in front of us the nachos be on a gigantic plate and pile high with cheese sour cream guacamole and shred chicken contain just the right amount of jalapenos they have a nice little kick as well in much the same way the quesadilla be much more than an appetizer portion with shred meats and cheese overflow from the tortilla there be enough food here for a two person entree the ball park pretzels be the reason we come to this place they be always so light and soft with just the right amount of salt as far as the beers be concern i order up the sampler so that i could get a taste of the various brew they make a wide assortment of brew from the bud lightesque lumpy dog to a dark brew master choice i find many of the beers to be quite tasty however nothing exactly special about them i would be that a taste test would find one hard press to choose the rock bottom brew over any off the shelf six pack dont get me wrong still excellent brew but i would expect more from a place that claim to be a brewery i give it 3 out of 5 rinsems due to the lack of originality in the brew and the amount of traffic involve with get in and out of the place horrible beer horrible service horrible menu summary if i be in the area and no one have a better suggestion for where to go i might come back for beer and appetizers good decent beer original pretzel appetizer you take chunk of soft pretzel and dunk it in spinach cheese dip huge portion most of us have leftovers the rb appetizer sampler be multistory and way more food that we could handle the half order of rib look like a full rack attentive service with quick seat and frequent drinkwater refill amuse name bad lot of food choices burgers steak chicken salads lot of drink choices beers win mix drink i guess this could be see as good but it take a while for everyone to pick something and since no ones awesome at everything you could tell right away that nothing distinguish this place none of the food be super awesome nothing be awful but nothing stand out in any way ive have better beer appetizers and a better main course at plenty of breweries kind of dead on a monday night with 34 of the place empty come if you want bar food but keep your expectations low i be a big fan of rock bottom there be several dish that be money appetizer sear ahi spinach artichoke dip entree fire steak pub tip or chicken fry chicken desert carrot cake to die for bar food pizza or ball park pretzels both of which be spray with brown ale half the menu be really good the other half be great the beer be good ask for the sampler they usually have a velvet and something on cask ask for one of those if you be look for something different they will also have a scotch ale an ipa whiskey stout or other specialty depend on the mood of the brewer which if its still matt the mood be grumpy if andy be still work there he be sure to please and molly be great in the cocktail area head over to sing sing after dinner and its a wrap i use to work there several years ago and i make it a point to hit every rb i possibly can dont go to the one in charlotte though its not really a rock bottom i think this place be pretty decent my friend and i be both still reel from thanksgiving dinner so we order salads and they be huge and tasty i like my salad though it be slather in way too much dress my friends be even more slather so she didnt dig it too much wed also order chip with guacamole the guac be pretty good my friend enjoy her beer i enjoy my coke i know im lame so yeah wasnt bad wasnt the best but it be okay microbrewed beers be only a plus to me when theyre better than the beer i would have drink otherwise one waitress i have while there try to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describe one of their beers as kind of like coors light if i want coors ill pay half as much and have one the food be actually a save grace as it be pretty good head next door to sing sing for drink though not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst i like the food and i have try all the beers theyre just ok as far as beer go large portion friendly staff my friends get everyhing from steakthey didnt even get a well do steak right to mahi tacos and the only great menu item be the season vegetables give it a miss sing sing next door be awesome but get dinner somewere else after we be do the waiter ask if we be ready for the check and i have order meal that come with a desert really dissapointing all around everytime i come here i stick with the nachos add chicken add side of guac and ive never be dissappointed i sit in the bar grab a drink or 2 and eat those nachos the bar have a pool table and plenty of flatscreens rock bottom be a chain but its one of the better chain in the area ill pass on chilis or fridays and come to rock bottom instead oh and typically i walk over to target work off some of those nachos nobody have review this in a while but i be surprise at the lack of lovin my husband and i eat here a few nights ago and we like it a lot we start with drinkshe get the housebrewed portland wheat and say it be quite a good beer and i get a mix drink red rock that be also tasty he get a burger cover in mozzarella cheese and i get a mahi sandwich both greatthe fry and side salads be good here too and there be no skimp on portion of anything there be tons of things on the menu that im look forward to try we be usually not dessert people at all but end the meal share a triple chocolate stout cheesecakewho can resist a beer cheesecake come on our food and service be great they have the penguins game on all the tvs in the bar and be set up live music for after the game seriously whats not to like im think this place have change for the better since the last review a year ago this be literally the first place i go when i first come to pittsburgh and i love it hearty fullsized meals lot to choose from and not too crowd or noisy although for the sake of full disclosure i didnt sit at the bar and i dont drink alcohol so i cant comment on that i go back to pittsburgh often and rock bottom end up be a good standby for a dinner and a movie kind of night really i have no complaints about this place so im surprise by the few low rat here little slow on the service and didnt have the beer i want on the menu but you get those things when they brew their own beers onsite but the stadium pretzels be good the cream stout be tasty the burgers be good and big with the little skinny fry im not a fan of the skinny fry but hey the burgers would choke a horse and almost do o lately the rock bottom be hit or miss the beers be always good and the uppity jagoff ipa be one of the best india pale ales ive ever taste the low point lately have be the food i will never forgive the idiot in management who take the chicken quesadilla off the menu that say i order the lobster roll and when it arrive the bread be as hard as a brick and cold the fill be okay but the lobster flavor be mask by over spice i suggest you eat somewhere else and imbibe at the rock bottom pretty good excellent beer sampler bargain veggie burger awesome onion ring awesome fry mac n cheese be delicious crunchy on the outside creamy on the inside carrot cake be monstrously huge and delicious first off i will say that i just move here from california and be a big patron at the rockbottom in long beach i come to the homestead location last night eager to see the beer at this location now rockbottom be a chain brewery so a lot be the same the menu the food price yet beer be cheaper and i be fine with that i have always find their food to be pricey but they use excellent ingredients and it have always be tasty and fill so i be fine with that the food here be just as good as the long beach location so i have no problem with the chef at all service be good our waitress be very friendly and helpful i wish that they have ask us if we want to sit in the bar since happy hour be still go but that isnt a big thing go to the bar to get a drink and have to wait awhile to get the bartenders attention but he be very friendly and i get a nice welcome from him and others at the bar when they learn i have just move here i really enjoy that beer we get the beer sampler to try the whole list and well i find the dark beers a bite lack in comparison the light beer and the wheat be amaze very impress the pale be ok as be the velvet pale that be one of the specials of the night but both be way too citrusy the uppity ipa be very good i dont usually like ipas because the hop overpower all flavor but the brewer have a good balance still couldnt do a whole glass i felt the imperial stout have a bitter burn taste that be overpower i almost want to say the batch have too much chocolate malt in it not ice cream malt for the nonhomebrewers the brown and amber be decent but bland i end up get an actual glass of the light beer and be able to finish it all without force it one point up on long beach who have a good light but the aftertaste get to you before the glass be empty i really want to try the das gut dopplebock but they be out look like they will have it in bottle to go soon so i hope i can catch that also want to try the snow moon belgian verdict while i be not too impress with the dark beers i find the lighter ones very good and i look forward to try the other seasonal beers it be a good hour drive south to get there so i wont be go too often but i will be back even since rock bottom open 7 years ago i have always think it be a dance club i be not really sure why but i think it be along the same line as throw back hitops but i do i think i always think this place be a club because of the behemoth size of the space well i be out with a friend and we need a place to go before a show at the improv and rock bottom be close part of this be my faulti always order healthy items at place that specialize be greasy bar foodthen i be upset when the meal isnt 5 star i start off with one of their wheat beers it be alright i nurse it all through dinner so i dont think i be head over heel in love with it i get the catch of the day off the hook fish dish sailors delight or somethingi forget it have some cheesy fish theme name it be cod meh that should have be the sign not to get it with roast asparagus and lemon rice the fish be suppose to be broil but it have a thick bread annoy and the portion of fish be tiny the rice and asparagus be great though my friend get a chicken sandwich which he enjoy although the fry be pathetic the fry be probably precut freeze fry or just very poorly execute they be so thin that you have to grab a huge handful just to get any actual potato flavor pros a lot of table no wait brew special beers big menu could hear the duel piano bar next door con place be fairly empty and we get a crappy table by the door when it be 5 degrees outside most of the food be fry cheese fill cream base or wrap in bacon i know some people love to eat food like this all the time i do every once in awhile but if you eat out a lot you cant always get the spin dip burger and ice cream sundae i would love to but its just not in my card i do like like when causal place offer some healthy options go with a group after work for dinner and a brew we order a few appetizers first the wing be good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip be fun have a burger you can create your own from veggie turkey or fresh grind beef have a fresh grind beef and the meat be fresh and cook perfectly with a fresh bun the brew pub be nice and be surprise it wasnt busier heres the trick to enjoy a meal at rock bottom dont get fancy with your food order stick with the sandwich salads burgers and bar food and youll be ok ive have bad experience will all the fish dish include the fish and chip also ive find the service be generally better in the bar area than the dinner area join the mug club even if you dont go often and rack up point for free mug and beers thursdays be trivia nights and the dj be play the music loud so go if you dont really want to have a conversation with the person youre with beer selection be good but they be out of the ones we want 4 of the 6 people in our group order steaks all of them be cook to their satisfaction the bourbanzola be a good addition defiantly a place i would go again joe our server be awesome and super friendly i love this place great atmosphere and friendly service every time i go rock bottom be a nice hangout place often when you be out and about with friends you arrive home with no voice from scream over all of the background noise great if your out to see a band but not so much fun if you actually want to talk to the people sit around you depend on your mood you can sit in the din area full of booths and table its alittle separate from the main bar area so provide for a semi quiet din area the bar area give you a choice of sit at the surround table with waitress service or hang out at the bar itself complete with a chillie ice strip to keep those yummy brew cold and the ever entertain company of your favorite bartender when the weather cooperate the outdoor patio house about 6 table for outdoor din the view howevernot so picturesque just the entrance to the improv which hey that could be the perfect seat if youre stock the local comics the bar area contain pool table and dart board to try your skills on any give night sport fan can enjoy the game of the day on one of the 6 big screen tvs surround the bar area the menu be pretty decent with burgers that be cook to order with the choice of either steak veggie or chicken they have a number of specialty burgers with different cheese toppings and creative theme the bourbonzolla be a tasty burger with a bourbon base glaze and gorgonzola cheese appetizers which range from nachos to firecracker shrimp steaks pasta and salads with rotate specials from different areas of the menu on monday the burgers be half offi dont think you have to be a member of their mug club to get the special however if you be here regularly the mug club be great with free gift and specials httpwwwrockbottomcommc needle to say i have a fun beer glass collection thank to rock bottomlol now everyone favorite part about rock bottom beers the in house brew master keep it interest with a rotate variety of frothy yummy to try along with the consistant favorites of ale ipas rotate darks and kolsch stop by on thursday nights for a colorful game of trivia where team battle it out in a game of intelligence and drink skills weve all have this happen to us you go past a place one hundred time and never go on then once you finally do you realize how many opportunities you waste rock bottom be definitely a solid bar as a microbrewery their beer list be full of house brew there be better beers in the world but there be a lot of worse beers out there too what really make rock bottom standout though be the food my girlfriend and i share an order of nachos and it take everything we have to finish them they also make a mean soft pretzel the waterfront may not be the most convenient thing to do while in pittsburgh but no trip to the waterfront be complete without a bite and a drink at rock bottom i would have to say im pretty partial to rock bottom i have be go almost every thursday for the past 3 years because of the fantastic team trivia my friends and i love the atmosphere the dj todd and the service that we get at rock bottom every week when we go a menu be never need because we pretty much know everything we want on it except for when the change the menu from time to time and we get to have a special treat with something new as an avid rock bottomer hand down i have never in my life have a better spicy spinach cheese dip than i have have here at rock bottom whether i have eat dinner or not before i come down to the restaurant my favorite and my food of choice be the enormous ball park pretzels with the cheese dip it be a meal itself the mixture of onions cheese spinach and tomatoes be perfection another favorite of mine be the barbecue chicken pizza it have a great kick to it and its big enough for two people the service have always be super great and now since we go often we have develop a great relationship with some of the wait staff a truly great place to have fun with friends and meet new people come to team trivia every thursday at 8pm rock bottom on thursday nights be the place to be team trivia start at 8pm and it be free to play the dj todd be great the food be good but the ball park pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip be the best the wait staff be generally pleasant and on top of things a few servers be excellent i be not a beer drink so i havent try the microbrews but the mix drink ive have have be good and a few of thier specials perfect on nights that be not trivia nights rock bottom be quiet and a good place for a small to medium party larger party will usually be split into two table overall an enjoyable place at which i be a regular so i have not be to one of these in awhile since i normally have an aversion to chain restaurants but since i be with colleagues on travel for work and they choose this place i go along first surprise decent beer i remember the normal rb brewery beers be not much to write home about but they have a couple of new style include a very good imperial ipa that for 5glass cannot be beat second surprise pretty tasty food with a lot more healthy options than i expect recommend the summer salad and the ahi tuna both be great service be a little slow not sure why so a 4star review be downgrade to 35 ill be back next time im in pittsburgh for work the beer be good their light beer lumpy dog be very good doesnt taste like a light beer when i be pregnant i become quite a fan of their root beer float too as others have note the pretzels be really good im not a fan of the spinach dip but my husband like it veggie burgers be always good too though the staff sometimes seem confuse when you order say the bourbonzola burger with a veggie burger long long ago when i use to go to the rock bottom in boston there be a hot mushroom sundried tomato cheese dip on the menu that be fantastic if they resurrect that i will gladly add another star i always feel like i be constantly bash breweries for their food but in my opinion i feel the bar be raise for place like this it seem there be so many breweries out there that offer great beer and slack off on the food unfortunately rock bottom be one that fall into that category let be honest when you go to a brewery you want the full experience if it be only about the beer id go buy a growler and take it home so about the beerexcellent the jagoff ipa be with out a doubt one of the best ipas i have ever have they only i can think of that i think be better be dogfish head but thats a matter of opinion the beer selection be constantly change and they always have some excellent seasonal beers you cant go wrong theres bind to be a beer everyone will like as for the foodits pretty much a crap shoot sometimes its good sometimes its terrible my biggest problem be there be absolutely no consistency when it come to the food one time its perfect then maybe its cold or its burn or it taste completely different from the last time you have it unfortunately it seem there be zero attention to food quality thats pretty much it this place fix its food consistency and its a five star place till then its hit or miss i be so ready to like this place turn out not so much it be okay no better than tgifridays but better than eat n park the deets the hubster and i be here on a saturday even after a show at the improv so we be happy and in a good mood and ready to enjoy some good eat we order drink he a wheat beer of their brew me my fave bloody mary with absolut peppar the hubster deem the beer acceptable but wouldnt go out of his way to come back just for another oneyes he do order another one just to be sure my bloody suck water down tomato juice with no discernible peppar of any kind let alone any other season even a good standard mix would have be better our very efficient and friendly waitress take it back and watch while it be remake by the other bartender nope no better at all that go back and i go with a youcantscrewitup amaretto sour it be fine hub order a reuben why ill never know because they simply never measure up to the gold standard of what use to be at the longlamented gazebo in shadyside you younguns wouldnt have a clue of the establishment of which i speak he say this one be fine i have the texas fire steak with jalapeno butter which i enjoy very much pack a punch of heat and flavor but the side be uninspired steam veggies any flavor be steam out in the process eh cheddar mash potatoes there be cheddar in there no way the tab be reasonable we do have a live social deal that take 30 off so our check be for 12 and change not include tip not bad even with the 15 cost of the ls deal but have we pay full price it wouldnt have be worth the experience well hit the improv again we have before but well head somewhere else afterwards i must admit i do like the brew i also like the white cheddar mash potatoes other than that meh the food be pretty forgettable another brewery that sadly fail to be anything special in the food department with the restaurants up the ante on 8th ave you may want to kick it up a notch rock bottom but how would anyone know to its a chain whomp whomp for a brewery who be attempt to take advantage of oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mash potatoes sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not be to germany not worth 595 unfortunately the sausage platter be 1595 din in twice food ok atmosphere good ive always be pleasantly surprise with the food ive get at rock bottom i say surprise because with any restaurant that fall into the slippery territory of a chain you expect to find your fair share of culinary duds but ive really have a lot of good meals at rock bottom now grant you do owe it to yourself when order to not forget where you be a barstraunt if you will and dont get anything above and beyond this place call of duty for instance i will never be order the ahi tuna ill leave that to my favorite sushi bar and restaurants a bite closer to the water the mon doesnt count but besides that i always really enjoy my meal choices ive recently get the chicken avocado sandwich chicken be grill perfectly plenty of avocado and it be a good size sandwich without be excessive ive also order the margherita pizza which could definitely be split between two people its an eight cut that come to you on a big wooden pizza paddle the pizza be really great the crust be crispy it have a good balance of cheese and tomatoes and the basil pesto be fresh and tasty and not greasy whatsoever big bonus point there but my biggest surprise as of late be when i order their chicken flautas im a huge mexican food fan and always hesitate to order mexican outside of a mexican restaurant for fear of be disappoint but i have an insatiable crave one night and decide to go for it it be delicious the flautas be deep fry which give you an amaze crunch and they still manage to not dry out the inner ingredients the accompany rice be nice and moist as well i be so happy ive always be quite happy with the service there as well i go on thursday even for trivia and nine time out of ten the service be really spot on the ladies service the bar area be friendly and attentive only once or twice to my memory have my service be subpar and that can usually be chalk up to an extremely pack trivia night with only two visible servers help 50 people i definitely give rock bottom two thumb up for take your typical chainfound food and make it fresh yummy and worth come back for more i go to rock bottom this past weekend and it be nice to see that nothing have change in the year or two since my last visit while the beer be pretty good it have never outweigh the fact that the service isnt good and the food be average at best it be even difficult to get beers at the barwe try to have the girls order think theyd have better luckwhen that fail the men triedthat didnt work either if we hadnt really want a cold beer after a comedy show at the improv we wouldve just leave it definitely wasnt busy enough to be notice and ignore by the bartender so i cant overlook it of course the service have always be spotty at rock bottom so it be hardly surprise combine the weak food and poor service with rock bottom be too far from home for a night out just to drink and you get the exact formula thats keep me from go there in the pastand will keep me from go often in the future happy hour at rock bottom 2 thumb up good price the pizza be delicious drink be a few dollars off the regular price good service and the atmosphere be always casual and fun the only reason rock bottom get 3 star be because of the brew food be eh not many vegetarian options and host who will ignore you because they be too busy chat about who didnt text them back this place have the potential to be great but sadly it fall way too short in almost all areas watch the fat girls in here they will try to steal your buddys chair in a sec if he go to the bathroom then the indignent fat girl have to get yell at in front of everyone w in ear shoot everything else include the burger beers i devour be excellent rock bottom be our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl as expect the bar be lively the food be good and the service be accommodate the beers be better than church brew work and the bar be populate the bartender readily offer a taste of beer and give us a hat to wear for the rest of the crawl i vote for rock bottom as the anchor store of the water work i havent be to rock bottom in years maybe even decadesis that even possible well either way its be awhile so with my gift certificate i take my brother out for a birthday dinner as i get older my tolerance for things like crowd and youngsters get lower and lower as a result i tell my brother to be ready by 4pm so we could head to the waterfront before everyone go out for date night plus the pirate be play at 405 so we could enjoy our beers and the game when we arrive the bar side be already pretty pack but we be still able to get a table our server be very attentive friendly and helpful right off the bat we both order samplers so we could try all of their beers we love the fact that as she approach our table with a full tray of sample our server say i have to go back for the rest in all we be serve 10 different beers each in 3 oz glass maybe 4 i can never tell i gotta say rock bottom know their beer i like more than i didnt and very few be not to my like so the 695 10 beer sampler be well worth it during our sample we indulge on some southwest egg roll they be okay but not quite what i expect the spicy ranch be top notch though as we run out of beer we each order up a kobe burger they be both cook exactly to our like medium and to top off our wonderful even the pirate bring home a win my only complaint as a beer drinker be the cost for a growler the glass container itself be sell for 1295 thats the empty price to me thats a little ridiculous when east end only charge 3 for the bottle and penn brewery 5 pay more for the bottle than the beer inside seem like insanity to me so i walk out empty hand but it wont deter me from return i just come here with some friends to hang out and get some appetizer and i have to admit that i be pretty satisfy with what we get though i couldnt find any fry pickle or onion ring on the apps section there be some blue cheese nachos that really hit the spot the atmosphere of this seem pretty cool especially in the pub area fish tacos be excellent great brew beers on tap as well i very much enjoy my first visit here i get the turkey meatloaf and it be really tasty its more sausage than turkey the cheesy mash potatoes be excellent the star of the night be the appetizer the artichoke and crab dip it be awesome my only complaint be i order a red ale and they be out i have the curmudgeon instead and it be very good but still slow service below average food ill pass first time i be here i have chicken quesadillas and they be bad we go again last weekend i have the chicken avacod sandwich it be very good no fat in the chicken just a mess to eat but still awesome also have the chocolate stout cupcake it be amaze thank to the staff here for be so friendly and cool with our whole mess rock bottom allow our bachelorette party to eat and drink and hang after dave and busters orphan us its not bad im not into chain kind of place but if youre with a group that doesnt do anything more adventurous youll do fine here i vacillate between 2 and 3 star but the house beer i have will make sure i come back from time to time go to rock bottom for lunch the other day and be very please my coworker have print out a coupon for a free mini appetizer the waitress tell us that they be not make mini appetizers and give us a full size chicken quesadilla if you have ever have the southwestern egg roll from chilis the fill taste like that and i be a big fan mondays be half off burger days and i try the just hot enough burger top with crispy jalapenos pepper jack cheese pico de gallo and housemade habanero ketchup it be delish the ketchup be so good and the fry be extremely crispy the price be a little steep for lunch but if you go on monday its totally worth it i think that the quality of food more than make up for it but dont expect for pay under 10 for a sit down i felt that the staff be very nice and the waitress be very attentive the service be quick and i think you can get in and out in under an hour rock bottom be a chain brew pub one that in my opinion be just ok the restaurant be rather large with lot of seat and a pool table they have many of their own brew that you can sample but to tell you the truth none of them be that good i have have several of their beers and all of them have be forgettable their food be pretty much like their beers forgettable i have have one of their burgers and their pizza and they really werent anything to write home about i feel they will impress those who have never be to a brew pub but i would probably describe them as the chilis of brew pubs if you be in homestead and be look for a burger and a beer it might be a good choice for a bite or at least until the burgatory open go here last night to meet folks for a friends birthday party dock one star due to a few unfortunate things that happen otherwise id be fine give this place a 3 our waiter be very attentive and keep our water and soda cup refill the food be decent overall i have a plain ol burger and a delicious berry sangria and the place overall have a nice vibe to it and be pretty comfortable and fun to be inyoud think this would just be another average place notgreatbutnotbad and id be ready to go on to the next review right there heres where i run into problems id check the website in advance to try and plan my meal since i do my best to pick items on menus that arent say 2000 calories in one sit their website advertise that they make skinny drink when i ask my waiter he say it be possible but that they do not normally do this and that its a hassle for the people at the bar so he didnt recommend it then why tell us on your website that youll do it additionally while we have check in advance when we make our reservation about bring a birthday cake and the restaurants ability to handle us light candle apparently there be a break down in communication we never get the candle we have ask for and in fact the poor waiter struggle to even find a lighter before realize there be no candle available obviously whatever error occur wasnt the waiters fault and we definitely thank him and tip him well for do the best that he could with what he have on a final note this be also one of those place where if you ask for a medium rare burger they will overcook it ive start order medium rare on purpose specifically so that i get a medium cook burger instead of medium well or well do final verdict go for the brew if you must and the foods nice enough i be admittedly leave a little underwhelmed mostly come here for the beer and sport fun place nothing special just like applebees chilis or fridays stick to the bar food burgers sandwich pizza wing and salads and you will be okay this be our second attempt at try rock bottom on father day the first time almost ten years ago we go in the early afternoon and they have already run out of steaks how do you do that on father day this time we go around 12 noon and beat the rush my wife get and love the berry bash sangria she just say it have too much ice in it our daughter get the root beer float which she love and i start with a mango ice tea but later switch for a raspberry ice tea as the mango ice tea wasnt sweet enough we start off the the kobe beef sliders as our app it take at least 15 minutes to get them you get three sliders and they be very good my wife get a small greenhouse salad with jalapeno ranch dress to start off with which she enjoy and the lobster shrimp enchiladas as her main entree she complain about how salty it be and the fact that there be no lobster in it at all our daughter get the kid burger and fry no surprise there i order the new york strip with mash potatoes and it come with green bean as well my strip be cook perfectly and have a decent taste longhorn have a much much better quality of steak though the green bean be pretty good and my mash potatoes very bland and pretty average the kitchen sound like an live episode of hells kitchen the waiters be repeatedly ask for order at least 5 to 6 time the kitchen be back up the whole time we be there on a different note our waitress susan be very good come here for drink and the bar food skip everything else i go to rock bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer so i be really really excite to have my bridal shower there my maid of honor reserve the banquet room which be very nice and separate from the rest of the restaurant my moh and mother say that the person they talk to about reservations and arrangements be wonderful and easy to get in touch with my shower be wonderful the wait staff be great and keep everyones glass full it start pour down rain and they let us stay a little longer so my gift wouldnt get wet when take them out to the car the only reason this place get 4 star be because we be not allow to take our leftover food from the buffet home there be salmon chicken potatoes and mac and cheese leave over and they tell us we couldnt box it up not sure why they cant reserve it it would have just go to waste also not at all relate to the shower their trivia night be super fun southwest egg roll and fish tacos mmmmmmmmm ohh and the amaze brew i rarely give a business a superior rat but i have to say my wife and i have one of the best din experience at the rock bottom brewery the food be delicious the beer every recipe sample be amaze and the service be wonderful the staff make us feel like we be the most important guests in the restaurant please support this business i guarantee you will not be disappoint im give 4 star mostly because of the beerlarge selection decent price the food be pretty good but nothing to rave about the menu have a good variety and everything ive try have be good portion be large one side of the restaurant be the bar bar atmospherewith several tvs 2 pool table its very wide open with extremely high ceilings the other side be more for families or people who arent concern about watch sport in general it have a relax atmosphere ive always have quick friendly service i love the whole waterfront areaso much to do im not much of a beer drinker but my fiancee be a major enthusiast so i agree to tag along im glad i do our waitress be very knowledgeable about the extensive housebrewed beer selection and help me to pick one i would love the kolsch be very crisp light and drinkable the food be standard pub fare with a twist wellexecuted my burger be top with onion petals and gorgonzola and cook to perfection the waitress recommend their macaroni and cheese for a side which be definitely a good choice my only complaint be that most of the food be rather heavy and i spend the rest of the night wallow on the couch not sure i would make the hour trip to pittsburgh again but if i find myself in the city i may just stop by come with my bf we start with the crab artichoke dip it be very greasy and have virtually no crab the wedge salad be good and crisp i have the hazelnut crust chicken this have to be one of the worst dish ive ever have it be like pancake syrup over bread chicken to finish the meal we have the homemade chocolate chip cookies serve with hot fudge well there be no hot fudge it be chocolate syrup the ice cream be so crystallize from melt and refreezing all around disappoint normally the food be outstanding no more salt bread stick but they do bring back the ball park pretzels not very good cool to low warm hard dense mango ice tea be wonderful will see how the chicken come out to be continue tom and i decide to try this place out before catch a late movie on a saturday night he be a beer buff and neither of us have ever be there so we give it a go we walk in around 8pm and we be tell that there would be an hour long wait we put our name on the list and go shop around the area about 25 minutes later our table be ready park be a cluster since the lot be share with dave busters and a karaoke bar call sing sing tom drop me off at the door so i could secure our table our server jackie approach me almost immediately and bring two water to the table to start she be very attentive and funny and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant tom order a red ale and to his surprise didnt care for it jackie give tom three free sample of beers she think he would like after talk to him about his beer drink habit he love all three and choose the most bizarre and expensive beer jackie switch the red ale to the beer of toms choice and charge us for the less expensive beer very nice of her we start out with the ball park pretzels with jalapeno dip the pretzels come out quickly and they be very fresh not to mention huge we only eat one and take the other to go very good app though tom order some sort of bacon cheeseburger and i get the chicken fry chicken which be a pound chicken breast bread and fry over white cheddar mash potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw toms burger come with a small handful of fry and my meal be very spread out on my plate like something be miss not very good presentation at all the food itself be okay nothing to write home about the potatoes be my favorite part tom say that his burger be mediocre another note the bathrooms be share with the sing sing karaoke bar that be in the same build so expect drink sing women in the bathrooms and bridestobe puke in the stall next to you after enjoy too much alcohol at their bachelorette party yuck overall we might come back for the beer and service but not for the food and definitely not to use the bathroom im a regular here since their kitchen be open late and its a good option after movies their nachos be pretty good i also try their burger and chicken sandwich and theyre good as well i think the only thing i didt like be the steak taco appetizer it be too sour and kinda tasteless the cajun pasta i order be just spicy enough to keep me sip my rock bottom ipa it may be a chain but i always get that microbrew restaurant feel when im here they could upgrade the quality of the servers but ive never have a really bad experience with the service i really miss the northstar amber but the specialty beers be always good food be excellent and the service staff be friendly so after an even of enjoy a comedy show at the waterfront we head to rock bottom for some late night grub the place be pretty busy we have to walk around the bar area for several minutes until a nice couple tell us they be about to leave and we could have their bar table as nice as this be of them it be awkward stand over them as they finish their drink pay their bill and leave so finally seat i look over the drink and be the huge ipa lover that i be i go with that and it be indeed a good choice the hubby have the red ale which be also rather good the service be ok not the best not the worst but move on to more important thing the food talk about miss the mark hugely i order the mini street fish tacos you get four mini tacos with a marinate in lime piece of fish and tomatillo salsa they be just stroke away from inedible i love fish tacos i mean it be such a simple concept so why do people have such a hard time execute this dish the shell be hard and literally split at the bottom when i pick them up the sour cream spray all over the plate only make them messy and the poor fish be just so overcook if i wasnt so hungry i wouldnt have eat them at all lesson learn on that the husband have the bbq chicken pizza it have bean and corn with roast red pepper on it along with some sour cream my husband be usually the type that will order these lovely specialty pizzas and ask for them to remove all the wonderful unique toppings for instance he would usually just say chicken bbq and cheese nothing else i refuse to let him do that this time because i be really intrigue in the combination of ingredients on this pie and boy be i jealous when it come out it blow my crappy tacos out of the water should have stick with something simple furthermore i could care less if i come back to this location the beers be good but hell you can get a decent ipa just about anywhere anymore and the underwhelming food seal the deal i know this be a chain but it still doesnt have to stink the food be delicious portion size generous atmosphere good our waitress lindy be outstanding have nothing but good things to say would highly recommend to everyone another good meal this time the housemade meatloaf its a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard grind beef a refresh and delicious twist on a comfort food staple serve over cheddar mash and mix veggies the server could have behave like she want to be there but everyone have a bad day once in awhile service be prompt just the same overall good experience i have to say that ive only be here when it be very busy i find the service fairly quick and any of the food ive have have be delicious i go there tonight and there be an issue with my food without go into detail i will say they handle it wonderfully our waitress mallory be very kind and she be quick to fix the problem i have the salmon for the second time and it be just as amaze as it be the first time i have one beer thats similar to a blue moon and that be good too i would go back again my husband and i get here a couple time a year always except my veggies today get great food at a decent price i love their side salad which have raisins and sunflower seed burgers be great and my husband love their chicken mac and cheese recommend to everyone just get there early for a seat poor service and food i wait 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence they finally bring my food out and leave it without ask for me to pay so i have to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay yes i have to try and give them money on to the important part food be terrible i have a burger and it be pathetic on a glorious day in the month of may my love and i stumble hungrily into rock bottom ha just kid i realize darren w hadnt review here so i have to start it cheesy the rock bottom line monday for lunch we have awesome service by ashley we werent rush and it be quite the burgers be great and half off the beer be very good we will be return for sure plan a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they do an amaze job help to pull it off service be extremely helpful professional and on point all night lauren one of the managers be reliable and pleasant throughout the entire plan process if anyone be look to plan an event i would highly recommend rock bottom couldnt be happier i love this restaraunt rarely have i ever receive service like i get here the food be good definitely reasonable for the price the thing that blow me away be the fact that my steak be cook to temperature this rarely ever happen at restaraunt of similar price range and quality but the servers be fantastic very attentive polite and timely the beer selection be awesome we always order the sampler i like have lot of options as far as beverages go the wait time isnt terrible if you go a little later on a friday or saturday night and they most often call you before the quote time the desert menu be a little small but i could probably skip it anyways the ambiance be good not to cram or noisy they also have outside seat available when the weather be nice i highly recommend this establishment i love this place great food and the best beer brew on site the bourbonzola burger be the best thing you can order here the staff here be very nice and the set up have tvs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sport the music be nice and pretty mellow and the place be very spacey and the price be pretty reasonable and most importantly be the place seem to be keep clean at all time good food and large portion i order the veggie burger for 850 and i love it its one of the most unique veggie burgers i have ever have a homemade patty of bean roll oats and veggies the chipotle mayo really give it that oomph my burger be more than enough for me to handle and everything be worth the price as for drink im a complete noob when it come to beer but my friend order a tap and even from a small taste i could tell it be very good quality beer bitter and sweet with a slight tang i rarely drink beer but i im go to then might as well drink the best kind there be fresh and microbrewed note there arent too many options for vegetarians the veggie burger be pretty good and id recommend it but other than that theres also the veggie tacos a few select appetizers and a few salads from which to choose ive never be crazy about the food here but my friend like it so i do eat here once in a while we stop in last night and i have the chicken finger appetizer with fry the food be a little overcook and nearly tasteless the ranch dress be barely good enough to make up for it my friend have the mac cheese with chicken and bacon which be what she order just about every time shes there it look delicious and the portion be huge ill be try this dish next time be there weve also have the ball park pretzels in the past and theyre really good im give 4 star because the service be great theres outdoor seat and the berry bash sangria be delicious if expensive well be back every time ive be here the food have always be delicious and the service have always be very exceptional my go to be the laredo burger and the mac ncheese as a side they mac n cheese be absolutely wonderful if you like garlic ive have a few other menu options as well that have be superb the beers on tap be always great my newest favorite be the first pumpkin ale one thing i really appreciate about rock bottom be that they arent one of these restaurants that try to rush you out when youre do eat the food come out fast which be great when youre starve but if you want to stay an visit with your date or eat companion theres never any rush i be just at rock bottom last night meet friends for a movie that didnt start until 11pm we get at the restaurant around 730 order drink eat and have a few more drink and then just hang out for about a half hour until it be time to walk over to the cinemas it be nice not feel rush to leave as soon as we stop order my only complaints be that sometimes meat end up be cook a little more than you often ask medium often turn into medium well but thats not a huge problem for me i also dont think the signature cocktails be worth 9 but thats more of a corporate complaint since rock bottom be a small chain overall i definitely recommend eat here if youre in the waterfront the food be standard american farea bite overprice in my mindand the beers range from mediocre to very bad the kölsch be the only decent beer of the bunch the service be good but the wait for food or a table can be quite long generally 2030 minutes even for just beer and apps ive be to the one at the denver airport as well but i be strand and have free meal ticket so okaybutnothingspecial pizza from rock bottom it be since its a recognizable national chain i think of place like this as more of a tourist brewery rather than a true pittsburgh craftbrew experience the beer be good but the food be nothing to brag about at all ive try many things on the menu and if you have develop a foodie palate dont even bother because you will be very disappoint if you feel comfortable with chain restaurants and their lack of innovative touch which nothing wrong with that you will most likely enjoy rockbottom the only entree i do enjoy be the lobster and shrimp enchiladas minus the repulsive bean and rice and the asiago crab dip as an appetizer otherwise you be better off skip it this place be quite big with a bar area din room area and patio area we decide to sit in the bar area so we could watch some football on one of the many tvs they also have dart and two pool table which i really enjoy when you be in the bar area you can see the beer be brew through the window which be really cool i order the hibiscus wheat beer and my friend order the white wheat both of which be brew by rock bottom they both taste delicious and be exactly what i need for a hot day my friend order the fry chicken entree which come with mash potatoes and of course she give me a few bite since we always share it be a pretty delicious meal but the fry crust fell off a few piece which i be not really a fan of i order the sante fe salad with grill chicken not fry the salad be okay i be expect more flavor overall but i didnt really get them it be a good experience and will most likely be back when i be around the waterfront area i be not a fan of chain restaurants typically and have to slow break my boyfriend from want to eat at chain restaurants all of the time the one chain that i cant break from be rock bottom their beer be always good as far as their staple go i really love their white ale their seasonal ipas have be good and my favorite seasonals of all time include their chocolate raspberry stout yes it taste as good as it sound they have it last year around christmas and their smoky bbq brown ale taste like summer complement bbq amazingly they have it this past summer i buy a growler of it lol as far as their food go i typically stay away from the appetizers 10 and up be a little too pricey for me as far as appetizers go ive have their southwestern roll and they be good but not worth 10 almost every time i go i order the baja chicken sandwich its my favorite chicken sandwich so good the chicken be actually grill which go for all of their chicken sandwich and i love the char flavor that it have the bun be soft but sturdy and doesnt fall apart while eat the sandwich the sauce be amaze the onion frizzle be the best and last but not least theres a half of a fresh avocado on this sandwich mhm i love it my boyfriend usually get the hickory bbq bacon chicken sandwich and love it as well another item i always get their apple coleslaw ive yet to find better coleslaw in a restaurant so simple yet oh so good they also recently change their fry and these be much better than their old ones their side salads be awesome as well they be decent in size spring mix top with sunflower seed raisins half of a hard boil egg which i give to the boyfriend chop cucumbers and tomatoes and croutons yum i usually order the same thing every time i go i steer off my normal path once and order the buffalo mac and cheese and find it to be quite tasteless which turn me off to try new items there plus i be just too in love with the baja chicken sandwich and apple coleslaw to want to try anything else service be always great the bartenders be friendly i love this place ask about their rock bottom reward be careful the servers cant pay attention to save their live and the management care even less i want to make sure people know how careless the management be particularly mark who seem to let his staff run around i always enjoy rock bottom standard beers on tap be always great and their rotate selection usually have a hit as well i prefer the bar seat as to the din room but this be a good way to separate the family din from those of us without kiddos nachos nachos nachos truly the best in the area great burgers chili and salads reallyi dont think ive have a bad meal here nice outdoor seat in the summer this be a great place to watch a game or just hang out ice counter at the bar to keep your drink cold i know they have other cocktails here but i cant order them at a beer place ive see them and they do look good but im stick to the beer selection they have a great happy hour and specials throughout the week service be always great whether there be two or 10 of us this be a okay place to eat the food be nothing special i guess what they have go for them be the beer order the guacamole for the starter which be okay but for 850 and the portion be not worth it rice cajun taco be not cook well would i go there again maybe if your into beer and watch the game then yeah go there ball park pretzelwould eat again i come to rock bottom look for a great beer full of hop that bring a refresh sensation and satisfaction i then open the menu scan look for those select bar items to pair with my great beer i saw an extensive list of items from chicken finger to salads i notice a ball park pretzel with a jalapeño cheese dip i be blow away the fact that i get 2 pretzels amaze me i order within 25 minutes of seat my pretzels hit the table within minutes the smell of the warm salt and hot cheese open my sense but i know we could step this shit up i ask for mustard and what do you know grey poupon dijon mustard be in front of my eye i combine that shit and life evolve i go to heaven it take me 35 minutes to write this review because i take a solid bite with grey poupon after each sentence good look rock bottom keep up the good work\n"
